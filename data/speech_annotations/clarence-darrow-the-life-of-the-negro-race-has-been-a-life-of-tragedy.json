  "introduction": "Clarence Darrow was America's most celebrated defense attorney, known for his courtroom skill and progressive politics. In 1926, he represented the Sweet family in Detroit—Ossian Sweet, his wife Gladys, and their relatives—who had armed themselves after white mobs attacked their new home in a segregated neighborhood. When a white man died in the chaos, all eleven residents of the house faced murder charges. Darrow's closing argument in the retrial of Henry Sweet, Ossian's younger brother, became one of the most powerful indictments of racial violence ever delivered in an American courtroom. The case drew national attention as a test of whether African Americans had the constitutional right to defend their lives and property. Henry Sweet was acquitted, after which prosecutors dropped charges against the remaining defendants. The courtroom was packed with Black observers who had traveled from across Detroit; the NAACP had recruited Darrow for his ability to transform a criminal defense into a moral and historical argument.",
  "analysis": "Darrow uses the Case History framework to embed the immediate criminal case within a sweeping historical indictment of American racism. He introduces the Sweet family as his primary subjects—'I ask you, on behalf of this defendant, on behalf of these helpless ones who turn to you'—but quickly expands the frame. The conflict section catalogs centuries of oppression with mounting urgency: 'Let us take a little glance at the history of the Negro race. It seems to me that the story would melt hearts of stone.' Darrow details the Middle Passage, slavery, lynching, and systematic exclusion from the promise of American freedom, insisting that 'if white men had been fighting their way against coloured men, nobody would ever have dreamed of a prosecution.' He broadens the lens explicitly, arguing the Sweets' case is not exceptional but the direct product of a racial system that has never delivered the equality it proclaimed. The call to action addresses the all-white jury directly: 'Their eyes are fixed on you, their hearts go out to you, and their hopes hang on your verdict.' Notice how Darrow repurposes the Case History framework in a legal context: the historical narrative functions as evidence, the defendants' humanity becomes proof of systemic injustice, and the jury's verdict is framed as a referendum on whether America means what it says about freedom.",
