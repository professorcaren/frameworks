  "introduction": "Yasser Arafat addressed the United Nations General Assembly on November 13, 1974, in a historic appearance that represented the Palestinian liberation movement's first major platform at the world body. His audience included representatives of nearly 200 nations, international media, and observers deeply divided on Middle Eastern politics. The occasion marked a watershed moment when the PLO gained observer status at the UN, legitimizing Palestinian claims for statehood and recognition. Arafat spoke at a time of deep Palestinian dispossession following decades of conflict, displacement, and occupation. His audience was fractured: some sympathetic to Palestinian self-determination, others supportive of Israel, many conflicted or ambivalent. By speaking bearing symbolically an olive branch, Arafat sought to reframe Palestinians as legitimate political actors pursuing justice rather than mere combatants, to establish Palestinian historical grievances as the world's responsibility, and to position his movement as seeking reasonable peace. His speech needed to educate the world about Palestinian history while making a compelling case for their rights.",
  "analysis": "Arafat's speech demonstrates the Detective Story framework through its historical investigation of Palestinian displacement. He opens by establishing the mystery: How did Palestinians become stateless and scattered across diaspora and occupation? The investigation phase traces the roots systematically—examining Zionist colonization, imperial partition schemes, territorial appropriations, and refugee crises as components of a larger pattern. Arafat builds evidence through historical narrative, showing how Palestinian displacement resulted not from natural causes but from deliberate policy and imperial intervention. The opposition takedown implicitly critiques counter-narratives that ignore Palestinian historical presence or justify displacement as inevitable development. His resolution proposes Palestinian statehood and self-determination as the answer to this historical wrong—positioning peace through justice rather than mere coexistence. Arafat's adaptation of the framework involves replacing legalistic investigation with historical narrative, making the detective work genealogical rather than forensic. He deviates slightly by emphasizing historical trauma documentation over forward-looking solutions, with peace presented more as restitution than innovation. Students learn how the Detective Story framework serves nationalist and liberation movements seeking international legitimacy, and how historical investigation becomes both evidence and argument in geopolitical disputes."
