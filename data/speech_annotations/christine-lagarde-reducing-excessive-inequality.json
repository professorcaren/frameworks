  "introduction": "Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, delivered this speech on June 17, 2015, to the Grandes Conférences Catholiques in Brussels—a prestigious lecture series dating to 1931. Lagarde spoke in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when rising inequality had become both a moral concern and an increasingly recognized economic problem. Her intervention was particularly significant because it came from the head of the IMF, an institution historically associated with free-market austerity prescriptions. By arguing that extreme inequality is economically destructive rather than merely unjust, Lagarde was repositioning a major multilateral institution's stance. Her audience included economists, policymakers, and business leaders who needed economic rather than moral arguments to act. Lagarde's speech represents a moment when institutional consensus shifted: redistribution was no longer framed as welfare-state ideology but as sound macroeconomic policy necessary for sustainable growth.",
  "analysis": "Lagarde applies the Rational Advocate framework to reframe inequality from a moral concern into an empirical economic problem, making it compelling to an audience of market-oriented policymakers. Her 'Clear Position Statement' is precise: 'My key message tonight is this: reducing excessive inequality—by lifting the small boats—is not just morally and politically correct, but it is good economics.' She immediately signals that the argument will proceed through evidence, not ethics. The 'Evidence Presentation' marshals IMF research with quantitative specificity: 'if you lift the income share of the poor and middle class by one percentage point, then GDP growth increases by as much as 0.38 percentage points...By contrast, if you lift the income share of the rich by one percentage point, then GDP growth decreases by 0.08 percentage points.' She cites the Oxfam statistic that the richest 1 percent will hold more wealth than the other 99 percent by 2016, and presents data on how inequality reduces investment in human capital and productivity. The 'Opposition Rebuttal' directly addresses the conventional wisdom that inequality is an 'acceptable price to pay for economic growth,' presenting contrary IMF analysis showing that 'benefits of higher income are trickling up, not down.' Her 'Logical Conclusion' links evidence to specific policy prescriptions: progressive taxation, investment in education, and social protection. Students should observe how Lagarde's institutional authority—speaking as IMF chief, not an activist—transforms the credibility of her redistributive argument, demonstrating that the Rational Advocate's power depends heavily on the speaker's positioning as dispassionate expert."
