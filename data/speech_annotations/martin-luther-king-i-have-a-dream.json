  "introduction": "Martin Luther King Jr. delivered this address on August 28, 1963, at the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom—a gathering of approximately 250,000 people, roughly a fifth of whom were white, that represented the largest civil rights demonstration in American history to that point. King had worked on the speech until 4am the night before, crafting the first half carefully; the famous 'I have a dream' sequence was largely improvised after gospel singer Mahalia Jackson shouted 'Tell them about the dream!' The march was organized to pressure Congress to pass President Kennedy's Civil Rights Bill. King spoke as the final speaker of the day, following leaders from the NAACP, CORE, SNCC, and labor unions. The speech begins with legal and constitutional argument, escalates through mounting urgency, then pivots to visionary prophecy that transcended politics and became a defining expression of American moral aspiration.",
  "analysis": "King's speech maps precisely onto the Emotional Escalator framework's six stages. The Attention Catalyst is the opening image of Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation as 'a great beacon light of hope,' immediately establishing the speech's moral and historical stakes. Problem Recognition escalates through specific grievances: 'the negro is still languished in the corners of American society'; victims of police brutality cannot gain lodging in motels; a Mississippi Negro cannot vote. The concrete injustices mount, each more visceral than the last. The Alternative Analysis rejects gradualism directly: 'This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquillizing drug of gradualism.' The Solution Vision appears in the speech's famous second half—the improvised dream sequence—where King describes children of former slaves and slaveholders sitting together, where Mississippi becomes 'an oasis of freedom,' where his own children are judged 'not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.' The Emotional Projection is the crowd at the base of the Lincoln Memorial, which King invokes as evidence of collective possibility. The Action Imperative closes the speech: 'Let freedom ring' from every mountain, valley, and state, until 'all of God's children...will be able to join hands' as brothers and sisters. Notice how the speech's emotional escalation is structural: the shift from legal argument to prophetic vision marks the transition from problem-focused stages to solution-focused ones.",
