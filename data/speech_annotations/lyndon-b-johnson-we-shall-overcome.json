  "introduction": "President Lyndon B. Johnson addressed a joint session of Congress on March 15, 1965, five days after state troopers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, used clubs and tear gas to attack peaceful voting rights marchers, an event broadcast on national television that shocked the nation. Johnson, a Texas Democrat who had fought to pass the 1964 Civil Rights Act, now faced the most consequential moment of his presidency: whether to use his political capital to force a voting rights bill through a Congress that included many Southern Democrats bitterly opposed to Black enfranchisement. His decision to adopt the words 'We shall overcome,' the anthem of the civil rights movement, as the title of his address was a deliberate act of solidarity with activists who had been beaten demanding the rights he was now promising to deliver. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 passed within five months.",
  "analysis": "Johnson employs the Call to Conscience framework with the authority of the presidency, transforming a political address into a moral referendum on American identity. He establishes shared moral ground by invoking the nation's own founding language: 'All men are created equal,' 'Government by consent of the governed,' 'Give me liberty or give me death.' He insists: 'Those words are promised to every citizen that he shall share in the dignity of man.' By grounding voting rights in America's stated ideals, Johnson makes opposing those rights a betrayal of the nation's self-definition. He demonstrates moral outrage with specificity about Selma: 'long suffering men and women peacefully protested the denial of their rights as Americans. Many were brutally assaulted. One good man\u2014a man of God\u2014was killed.' He then catalogs the specific absurdities of voter suppression: being told 'the day is wrong, or the hour is late'; failing a test that 'even a college degree cannot be used to prove.' The Contrast with Moral Ideal is framed as an existential choice: 'should we defeat every enemy...and still be unequal to this issue, then we will have failed as a people and as a nation.' His Call to Moral Action commits the federal government and Congress to act: 'We must now act in obedience to that oath.' Observe how Johnson's appropriation of 'We shall overcome' performs conscience: a Southern president publicly aligning with those his party's Southern wing had attacked, making the act of solidarity itself an argument.",
