  "introduction": "David Lloyd George served as Chancellor of the Exchequer under Liberal Prime Minister H.H. Asquith when he introduced the landmark 'People's Budget' of 1909—a revolutionary piece of legislation imposing progressive taxes on income, land values, and inheritance to fund old-age pensions, unemployment insurance, and naval expansion. The budget provoked a constitutional crisis: the House of Lords, dominated by landed aristocrats whose wealth it directly targeted, rejected it—an unprecedented act that ultimately led to curtailing the Lords' veto power. Lloyd George's speeches defending the budget, delivered in halls across Britain, became defining moments of his political career and of the early British welfare state. His audience was simultaneously Parliament and the British working public, whom he was mobilizing against aristocratic obstruction. The speech represents a foundational moment when progressive taxation was articulated not as class warfare but as sound public finance and moral obligation.",
  "analysis": "Lloyd George structures his defense of the People's Budget around the Rational Advocate framework, grounding economic argument in concrete evidence and systematic rebuttal. His 'Clear Position Statement' establishes both the practical need—revenue for Dreadnoughts, pensions, and unemployment insurance—and the principle: 'it is rather a shame for a rich country like ours...that it should allow those who have toiled all their days to end in penury.' He then turns this into a cost-benefit question: who should bear the cost of national obligations? The 'Evidence Presentation' uses a striking rhetorical technique: Lloyd George descends a coal mine to provide vivid testimony about the conditions that create the need for pensions, then confronts the landlords who profit from those miners' labor but 'scowl' when asked for 'only a ha'penny.' He presents the arithmetic of the crisis: four Dreadnoughts at eight million each, then four more—'somebody has got to pay.' The 'Opposition Rebuttal' methodically exposes the aristocrats' position: they demanded naval spending but refuse to fund it; they invoked 'democracy, liberty, and justice' while blocking democratic redistribution. He demolishes their threat to 'discharge labour' as blackmail rather than principle. His 'Logical Conclusion' is a challenge: 'By that test, I challenge them to judge the budget.' Students should observe how Lloyd George fuses statistical argument with vivid testimony—the coal mine visit, the image of an old worker 'bleeding and footsore' through poverty—maintaining the Rational Advocate's evidentiary discipline while generating emotional resonance."
