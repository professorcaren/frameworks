  "introduction": "Leon Trotsky delivered this speech on November 8, 1937, at the New York Hippodrome before American leftists, labor organizers, and curious observers. A founding figure of the Soviet Union and architect of the Red Army, Trotsky had been expelled from the USSR in 1929 and was living in Mexican exile when Stalin's show trials accused him of orchestrating sabotage, assassination, and treason. The Great Purge was reaching its height, and Stalinist prosecutors were convicting and executing Old Bolsheviks on fabricated charges. Tried in absentia, Trotsky faced denunciation without the ability to confront his accusers in Moscow. Before a sympathetic but skeptical audience, he countered the Soviet narrative by demanding an independent investigation, staking his life on the outcome. He replaced mere denial with investigative evidence, turning political self-defense into a formal prosecution of his prosecutors.",
  "analysis": "Trotsky structures his speech around the Detective Story framework's four stages. The Opening Mystery surfaces in his first sentence: 'Why does Moscow so fear the voice of a single man?' He frames his own silencing as the puzzle demanding investigation: if the charges were true, why suppress rather than confront him? The Investigation phase occupies the bulk of the speech, where Trotsky dismantles the prosecution's evidence. He highlights the logical impossibility at the conspiracy's core: 'According to the official version, the Trotskyists had been organizing the most monstrous plot since 1931. However, all of them...spoke and wrote in one way but acted in another.' He invokes the Latin legal principle 'is fecit cui prodest' to redirect the investigation toward Stalin himself. The Opposition Takedown attacks the credibility of the confessions by comparing GPU interrogation methods to the medieval Inquisition, arguing that torture produced them, not truth. His Resolution names the guilty party: 'Whose? Cui prodest? Who benefits? The hand of Stalin!' Notice how Trotsky weaponizes the detective framework for self-defense, replacing the typical reform proposal with a demand for an impartial tribunal."
