  "introduction": "Leon Trotsky delivered this speech on November 8, 1937, at the New York Hippodrome before an audience of American leftists, labor organizers, and curious observers. A founding figure of the Soviet Union and architect of the Red Army, Trotsky had been expelled from the USSR in 1929 and was living in Mexican exile when Stalin's show trials accused him of orchestrating sabotage, assassination, and treason. The timing was existential: the Great Purge was reaching its height, and Stalinist prosecutors were convicting and executing Old Bolsheviks on fabricated charges. Trotsky, tried in absentia, faced denunciation without the ability to confront his accusers in Moscow. Speaking before a sympathetic but skeptical audience, he sought to counter the Soviet narrative by demanding an independent investigation, staking his life on the outcome. This speech became one of history's most dramatic acts of political self-defense, presenting investigative evidence in place of mere denial.",
  "analysis": "Trotsky structures his speech around the Detective Story framework's four stages, and the 'Opening Mystery' emerges in his very first sentence: 'Why does Moscow so fear the voice of a single man?' He frames his own silencing as the puzzle that demands investigation—if the charges were true, why suppress rather than confront him? The 'Investigation' phase occupies the bulk of the speech, where Trotsky systematically dismantles the prosecution's evidence. He highlights the logical impossibility at the conspiracy's core: 'According to the official version, the Trotskyists had been organizing the most monstrous plot since 1931. However, all of them...spoke and wrote in one way but acted in another.' He invokes the Latin legal principle 'is fecit cui prodest'—he who benefits is the guilty one—to redirect the investigation toward Stalin himself. The 'Opposition Takedown' attacks the credibility of the confessions by comparing GPU interrogation methods to the medieval Inquisition, arguing that torture, not truth, produced them. His 'Resolution' names the guilty party: 'Whose? Cui prodest? Who benefits? The hand of Stalin!' Students should note how Trotsky weaponizes the detective framework for self-defense, replacing the typical reform proposal with a demand for an impartial tribunal to vindicate his innocence."
