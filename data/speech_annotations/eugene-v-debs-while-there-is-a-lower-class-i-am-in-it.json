  "introduction": "Eugene V. Debs was America's most prominent Socialist leader in the early twentieth century, founder of the Social Democratic Party and five-time presidential candidate. This speech is his statement before sentencing in federal court in September 1918, delivered after his conviction under the Espionage Act for a June 1918 speech in Canton, Ohio, in which he criticized the war and American capitalism. Debs knew he faced years in prison and used his sentencing as a final platform. Speaking directly to the judge, he defended his entire life's work—his years firing freight engines, organizing workers, running for president from a jail cell—as an expression of solidarity with working people. His sentence: ten years in federal penitentiary. He ran for president again in 1920 from his prison cell and received nearly one million votes. President Harding commuted his sentence in 1921.",
  "analysis": "Debs employs the Case History framework with an unusual inversion: he is simultaneously the narrator and the protagonist. He introduces his subject by beginning with his own childhood: 'At fourteen I went to work in a railroad shop; at sixteen I was firing a freight engine on a railroad.' This autobiography is not vanity—it establishes that he speaks from lived working-class experience, not theory. The conflict section expands outward from his personal history to encompass the entire system: 'the men in the mills and factories...the women who for a paltry wage are compelled to work out their barren lives...the little children...seized in the remorseless grasp of Mammon.' These vivid particulars build a portrait of systemic suffering that contextualizes his own prosecution as one instance of a larger pattern. He broadens the lens explicitly: 'I am opposing a social order in which it is possible for one man who does absolutely nothing that is useful to amass a fortune of hundreds of millions of dollars, while millions...secure barely enough for a wretched existence.' His individual case stands for a class. The call to action through empathy becomes defiance: 'I ask no mercy and I plead for no immunity...I am now prepared to receive your sentence.' Notice how Debs inverts the typical Case History victim-protagonist: he is not asking the audience to help someone else—he uses his own willingness to suffer as proof that his cause justifies the sacrifice, making himself both the story and the argument.",
