  "introduction": "Eugene V. Debs was the most prominent Socialist leader in early twentieth-century America, founder of the Social Democratic Party and five-time presidential candidate. This speech is his statement before sentencing in federal court in September 1918, delivered after his conviction under the Espionage Act for a June 1918 speech in Canton, Ohio, in which he had criticized the war and American capitalism. Debs knew he faced years in prison and chose to use his sentencing as a final platform. Speaking directly to the judge, he defended his entire life's work—his years firing freight engines, organizing workers, running for president from a jail cell—as an expression of solidarity with working people everywhere. His sentence: ten years in federal penitentiary. He ran for president again in 1920 from his prison cell and received nearly one million votes. President Harding commuted his sentence in 1921. This brief statement became one of the most celebrated expressions of socialist conviction in American history.",
  "analysis": "Debs employs the Case History framework with an unusual inversion: he is simultaneously the narrator and the protagonist. He 'Introduces the Subject' by beginning with his own childhood: 'At fourteen I went to work in a railroad shop; at sixteen I was firing a freight engine on a railroad.' This autobiography is not vanity—it establishes that he speaks from lived working-class experience, not theory. The 'Conflict' section expands outward from his personal history to encompass the entire system: 'the men in the mills and factories...the women who for a paltry wage are compelled to work out their barren lives...the little children...seized in the remorseless grasp of Mammon.' These vivid particulars build a portrait of systemic suffering that contextualizes his own prosecution as one instance of the larger pattern. He 'Broadens the Lens' explicitly: 'I am opposing a social order in which it is possible for one man who does absolutely nothing that is useful to amass a fortune of hundreds of millions of dollars, while millions...secure barely enough for a wretched existence.' His individual case stands for a class. The 'Call to Action Through Empathy' is transformed into defiance: 'I ask no mercy and I plead for no immunity...I am now prepared to receive your sentence.' Students should observe how Debs inverts the typical Case History victim-protagonist: he is not asking the audience to help someone else—he is using his own willingness to suffer as proof that his cause justifies the sacrifice, making himself both the story and the argument."
