  "introduction": "Fidel Castro delivered this speech in his own defense at the trial following the failed July 26, 1953 assault on the Moncada Barracks in Santiago de Cuba. The attack aimed to spark a broader uprising against Fulgencio Batista's dictatorship but was crushed; many rebels were tortured and killed. Castro was arrested, imprisoned, and tried. Speaking from the courtroom dock, Castro constructed a comprehensive indictment of Batista's regime and articulated his revolutionary vision. Though the court convicted him, the speech's clandestine publication made him a folk hero. His defense of violence against tyranny and his vision of social transformation resonated across Latin America and the Caribbean. The trial transformed Castro from an obscure activist into a symbol of anti-imperialist resistance. Clandestine organizers distributed the speech across Cuba in the years that followed, building the ideological foundation for the revolution that toppled Batista in 1959.",
  "analysis": "Castro employs the Case History framework through vivid personal and collective narratives. He introduces the failed barracks attack itself as a case study, but more fundamentally uses the history of Cuban oppression—under colonialism and then Batista's dictatorship—as his primary character study. The conflict section catalogs brutal descriptions of poverty, political repression, foreign exploitation, and state violence against civilians, building an overwhelming portrait of systematic suffering. Castro broadens the lens by arguing that the Moncada attack represents not a failed military venture but a necessary response to intolerable conditions—his individual defiance mirrors the collective desperation of the Cuban people. The call to action is militant: rather than asking audiences to help a suffering individual, Castro frames revolutionary violence as the only moral response to state oppression. The framework deviates by prioritizing ideology and collective action over intimate character study. Notice how Case History adapts to revolutionary contexts, where personal narrative becomes national allegory and individual sacrifice positions itself as emblematic of justified resistance to tyranny. The framework justifies radical action through accumulated grievance rather than through an appeal to help a single protagonist.",
