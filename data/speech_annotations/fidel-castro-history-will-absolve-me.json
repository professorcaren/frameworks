  "introduction": "Fidel Castro delivered this speech in his own defense at the trial following the failed July 26, 1953 assault on the Moncada Barracks in Santiago de Cuba. The attack aimed to spark a broader uprising against Fulgencio Batista's dictatorship but was crushed; many rebels were tortured and killed. Castro was arrested, imprisoned, and later tried. Speaking from the courtroom dock, Castro constructed a comprehensive indictment of Batista's regime and articulated his revolutionary vision. Though the court convicted him, the speech's clandestine publication made him a folk hero. His eloquent defense of violence against tyranny and his vision of social transformation resonated across Latin America and the Caribbean. The trial transformed Castro from obscure activist into a symbol of anti-imperialist resistance. The speech laid ideological groundwork for the revolution that would succeed just five years later, making it a defining moment in twentieth-century revolutionary rhetoric.",
  "analysis": "Castro employs the Case History framework through vivid personal and collective narratives. He introduces the failed barracks attack itself as a case study but more fundamentally uses the history of Cuban oppression—under colonialism and then Batista's dictatorship—as his primary character study. The 'conflict' section catalogs brutally vivid descriptions of poverty, political repression, foreign exploitation, and state violence against civilians, building an overwhelming portrait of systematic suffering. Castro broadens the lens by arguing that the Moncada attack represents not merely a failed military venture but a necessary response to intolerable conditions—his individual defiance mirrors the collective desperation of the Cuban people. The call to action is present but militant: rather than asking audiences to help a suffering individual, Castro frames revolutionary violence as the only moral response to state oppression. The framework deviates significantly by prioritizing ideology and collective action over intimate character study. Students can observe how Case History adapts to revolutionary contexts, where personal narrative becomes national allegory and individual sacrifice is positioned as emblematic of justified resistance to tyranny. The speech demonstrates how the framework can justify radical action through accumulation of grievance and moral clarity."
