  "introduction": "William Pitt the Younger, then Prime Minister of Britain, addressed the House of Commons at a late hour on April 2, 1792, in support of the resolution that 'the trade carried on by British subjects, for the purpose of obtaining slaves on the coast of Africa, ought to be abolished.' Britain was the world's largest slave trading nation, and Parliament had repeatedly delayed abolition despite growing abolitionist pressure from figures like William Wilberforce. The motion had been amended to phase in abolition gradually, a compromise Pitt found troubling, but he spoke in its support nonetheless. His audience included legislators whose fortunes were directly tied to the slave trade and colonial plantations. Pitt was making a personal moral statement at considerable political cost. The amended resolution passed 230 to 85, though abolition would not actually take effect until 1807, a fact that illustrates how moral conscience in institutional settings often produces delayed, partial results.",
  "analysis": "Pitt structures his speech around the Call to Conscience framework, deploying his moral authority as Prime Minister to demand that Parliament confront what its prosperity is built upon. He establishes shared moral ground through a rhetorical series of parallel conditionals: 'If then we feel...if we view...if we shudder'—each invoking a moral response that any person of conscience must feel upon contemplating the slave trade. This technique forces the audience to acknowledge their own moral sense before he names what it demands. He demonstrates moral outrage by asking his colleagues to follow the trajectory of British history: 'How shall we hope to obtain...forgiveness from heaven for those enormous evils we have committed?' He frames the slave trade not as a distant abstraction but as Britain's direct moral responsibility, carrying centuries of accumulated guilt. The Contrast with Moral Ideal presents abolition as Britain living up to its self-image as a civilized, Christian nation committed to liberty, an image the slave trade comprehensively contradicts. His Call to Moral Action is structured as obligation: this is 'the most pressing and indispensable duty.' Observe how Pitt's institutional position simultaneously amplifies and constrains his conscience appeal: a Prime Minister endorsing abolition lends it political legitimacy, but maintaining his governmental coalition means he accepts the gradualist compromise that moral consistency would have rejected outright."
