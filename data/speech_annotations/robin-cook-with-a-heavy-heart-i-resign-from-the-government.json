  "introduction": "Robin Cook served as the United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary from 1997 to 2001 under Prime Minister Tony Blair before becoming Leader of the House of Commons. On March 17, 2003, as British forces prepared to join the American invasion of Iraq, Cook delivered this resignation speech to Parliament—the most watched parliamentary statement of the era. Cook had spent four years responsible for Western containment policy toward Iraq and had access to classified intelligence assessments about Saddam Hussein's weapons capabilities. His resignation carried weight because of his insider knowledge: he was not an antiwar protester but a senior official who had evaluated the evidence and found it insufficient to justify military action. Speaking to parliamentary colleagues who would vote the next day, Cook made his case through measured, documented argument about burden of proof, international consensus, and the distinction between possibility and verified threat.",
  "analysis": "Cook's resignation speech demonstrates the Rational Advocate framework deployed under extreme institutional pressure. His Clear Position Statement defines both the problem and his standard: 'I cannot support a war without international agreement or domestic support.' He establishes the evidentiary threshold he will apply throughout. The Evidence Presentation is systematic: Cook cites the absence of a second UN Security Council resolution; the opposition of France, Germany, and Russia; the failure to achieve NATO or EU consensus. He deploys his own expert testimony as former foreign secretary: 'Over the past decade that strategy destroyed more weapons than in the Gulf War, dismantled Iraq's nuclear weapons programme.' He identifies the key logical paradox in the government's position: 'We cannot base our military strategy on the assumption that Saddam is weak and at the same time justify pre-emptive action on the claim that he is a threat.' The Opposition Rebuttal addresses comparisons to Kosovo—noting NATO support existed then but not now—and rebuts the impatience argument by asking why thirty-year Israeli non-compliance with Resolution 242 receives no similar urgency. His Logical Conclusion is measured: lacking international legitimacy, domestic support, and verified imminent threat, military action cannot be justified. Note how Cook's credibility as a former foreign secretary, rather than an outsider, makes his argument more devastating than any external critique could have been.",
