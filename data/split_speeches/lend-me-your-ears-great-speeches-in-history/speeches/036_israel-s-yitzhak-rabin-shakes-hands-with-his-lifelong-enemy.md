# Israel's Yitzhak Rabin Shakes Hands with His Lifelong Enemy {#part0043.html_c36 .toc}

*"We who have fought against you, the Palestinians---we say to you today, in a loud and a clear voice: enough of blood and tears. Enough!"*

The lawn of the White House in Washington was the scene of the signing of a peace agreement, secretly negotiated in Oslo, between the government of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization. President Bill Clinton introduced Prime Minister Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat with a biblical allusion: "We must realize the prophecy of Isaiah, that the cry of violence shall no more be heard in your land, nor wrack nor ruin within your borders."

Rabin made a momentary show of reluctance to shake the former terrorist's []{#part0043.html_page171}hand, then did so. The former general's short speech, drafted by his veteran spokesman Eitan Haber, hewed to the style of a plain soldier. The audience on the lawn, including this anthologist, noted the strength modified by pain in the delivery. Rabin spoke directly to his former enemies, addressing them not as "Palestinian Arabs" but giving them the status of a people: "Let me say to you, the Palestinians..." He was also speaking to his own people, many of whom were ambivalent about or opposed to the ultimate direction of the "peace process." As a soldier turned peacemaker, he evoked the Book of Ecclesiastes 3:1--8 to dramatize the reason for his new direction: "To everything there is a season... A time to love and a time to hate, a time of war and a time of peace."

Especially powerful to the Jews listening to him on the lawn and around the world on September 13, 1993, was his conclusion, spoken in Hebrew. What he described as "words taken from the prayer recited by Jews daily" were from the Kaddish, which are also spoken in a Mourners' Kaddish at graveside and repeated by the bereaved in remembrance of the dead. The prayer makes no mention of death; rather, it affirms faith in God even in the midst of death. As the speaker buried the past, his choice of Hebrew words remembered its bloodshed.

After Prime Minister Rabin's assassination by an Israeli fanatic two years after this speech, the memory of that prayer was especially poignant, and all television obituaries included his exhortation "Enough!"

**[PRESIDENT OF THE]{.small}** United States, your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen: This signing of the Israeli-Palestinian declaration of principle here today---it's not so easy---neither for myself as a soldier in Israel's war nor for the people of Israel, not to the Jewish people in the diaspora, who are watching us now with great hope mixed with apprehension. It is certainly not easy for the families of the victims of the war's violence, terror, whose pain will never heal, for the many thousands who defended our lives in their own and have even sacrificed their lives for our own. For them this ceremony has come too late.

Today on the eve of an opportunity, opportunity for peace and perhaps end of violence and war, we remember each and every one of them with everlasting love. We have come from Jerusalem, the ancient and eternal capital of the Jewish people. We have come from an anguished and grieving land. We have come from a people, a home, a family that has not known a single year, not a single month, in which mothers have not []{#part0043.html_page172}wept for their sons. We have come to try and put an end to the hostilities so that our children, our children's children, will no longer experience the painful cost of war: violence and terror. We have come to secure their lives and to ease the soul and the painful memories of the past---to hope and pray for peace.

Let me say to you, the Palestinians, we are destined to live together on the same soil in the same land. We, the soldiers who have returned from battles stained with blood; we who have seen our relatives and friends killed before our eyes; we who have attended their funerals and cannot look in the eyes of their parents; we who have come from a land where parents bury their children; we who have fought against you, the Palestinians---we say to you today, in a loud and a clear voice: enough of blood and tears. Enough!

We have no desire for revenge. We harbor no hatred towards you. We, like you, are people---people who want to build a home. To plant a tree. To love---live side by side with you. In dignity. In empathy. As human beings. As free men. We are today giving peace a chance---and saying to you and saying again to you: enough. Let us pray that a day will come when we all will say farewell to the arms. We wish to open a new chapter in the sad book of our lives together---a chapter of mutual recognition, of good neighborliness, of mutual respect, of understanding. We hope to embark on a new era in the history of the Middle East. Today here in Washington at the White House, we will begin a new reckoning in the relations between peoples, between parents tired of war, between children who will not know war.

President of the United States, ladies and gentlemen, our inner strength, our high moral values, have been the right for thousands of years, from the book of the books. In one of which, we read: "To everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under heaven: a time to be born and a time to die... a time to kill and a time to heal... a time to weep and a time to laugh... a time to love and a time to hate, a time of war and a time of peace." Ladies and gentlemen, the time for peace has come.

In two days the Jewish people will celebrate the beginning of a new year. I believe, I hope, I pray that the new year will bring a message of redemption for all peoples---a good year for you, for all of you; a good year for Israelis and Palestinians; a good year for all the peoples of the Middle East; a good year for our American friends who so want peace and are helping to achieve it.

For presidents and members of previous administrations, especially for you, President Clinton, and your staff, for all citizens of the world, may []{#part0043.html_page173}peace come to all your homes. In the Jewish tradition it is customary to conclude our prayers with the word *Amen*. With your permission, men of peace, I shall conclude with the words taken from the prayer recited by Jews daily, and whoever of you who volunteer, I would ask the entire audience to join me in saying Amen. \[Speaking in Hebrew.\] May He who brings peace to His universe bring peace to us and to all Israel. Amen.
