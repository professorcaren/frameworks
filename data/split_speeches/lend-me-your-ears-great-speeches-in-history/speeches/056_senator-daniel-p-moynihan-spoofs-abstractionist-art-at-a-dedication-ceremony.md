*"Aesthetic transubstantiation... at once elusive yet ineluctable...."*
:::

Pat Moynihan, academic turned White House domestic adviser and later senator from New York, made his mark as a supporter of the dignity of ethnicity and the creator of family assistance programs. He also had an offbeat sense of humor, which led him to the sponsorship of the thirty-two-letter "floccinaucinihilipilificationism" (meaning "the action of estimating as worthless") as "the longest word in the English language."

At the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, in the nation's capital on July 19, 1978, he was asked for dedicatory remarks on the receipt of the massive sculpture *Isis* by the artist Mark di Suvero. The hard-to-ignore work is apparently the impression of the severed brow of a Grimsby trawler, appropriately given to the nation by the Institute of Scrap Iron and Steel. The senator's dedication was both succinct and mouth filling.

\*\*\*

**[AS CHAIRMAN OF]{.small}** the board of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden it falls to me to accept this splendid gift from the Institute of Scrap Iron and Steel, and I recall that on the occasion that Margaret Fuller declared, "I accept the universe," Carlyle remarked that she had better.

*Isis* achieves an aesthetic transubstantiation of that which is at once elusive yet ineluctable in the modern sensibility.

Transcending socialist realism with an unequaled abstractionist range, Mr. di Suvero brings to the theme of recycling both the hard-edge reality of the modern world and the transcendent fecundity of the universe itself; a lasting assertion both of the fleetingness of the living, and the permanence of life; a consummation before which we stand in consistorial witness.

It will be with us a long time.
