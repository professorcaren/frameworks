# Senator Everett Dirksen Extols the Marigold {#part0135.html_c122 .toc}

*"It beguiles the senses and ennobles the spirit of man."*

Conservative Republican Dirksen of Illinois came to national attention denouncing moderate Thomas E. Dewey of New York at a GOP convention for having "led us down the road to defeat." In later years, the senator became more likable, especially to journalists who enjoyed his colorful dramatics in a deep baritone and dubbed him the Wizard of Ooze.

Here is an example of a "little speech" of little legislative import, but touching a chord of symbolism that reverberates long after speeches on weighty matters have lost their zing.

[]{#part0135.html_page566}Dirksen periodically submitted a bill to the Senate to establish a national floral symbol, much as the American bald eagle was the animal symbol (over the objection of Benjamin Franklin, who preferred the turkey). Others thought no national flower should be chosen, reflecting the idea of the United States as a bouquet of many states' flowers, but Dirksen vainly plumped for the marigold. This speech was given on April 17, 1967; in 1986, Congress decided to adopt a national floral symbol, and President Reagan signed the bill so designating the rose.

**[MR. PRESIDENT: ON]{.small}** January 8, 1965, I introduced Senate Joint Resolution 19, to designate the American marigold---*Tagetes erecta*---as the national floral emblem of the United States. Today I am introducing the same resolution with the suggestion that it again be referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.

The American flag is not a mere assembly of colors, stripes, and stars but, in fact, truly symbolizes our origin, development, and growth.

The American eagle, king of the skies, is so truly representative of our might and power.

A national floral emblem should represent the virtues of our land and be national in character.

The marigold is a native of North America and can in truth and in fact be called an American flower.

It is national in character, for it grows and thrives in every one of the fifty states of this nation. It conquers the extremes of temperature. It well withstands the summer sun and the evening chill.

Its robustness reflects the hardihood and character of the generations who pioneered and built this land into a great nation. It is not temperamental about fertility. It resists its natural enemies, the insects. It is self-reliant and requires little attention. Its spectacular colors---lemon and orange, rich brown and deep mahogany---befit the imaginative qualities of this nation.

It is as sprightly as the daffodil, as colorful as the rose, as resolute as the zinnia, as delicate as the carnation, as haughty as the chrysanthemum, as aggressive as the petunia, as ubiquitous as the violet, and as stately as the snapdragon.

It beguiles the senses and ennobles the spirit of man. It is the delight of the amateur gardener and a constant challenge to the professional.

Since it is native to America and nowhere else in the world, and common to every state in the Union, I present the American marigold for designation as the national floral emblem of our country.
