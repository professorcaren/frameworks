*"If I committed some abominable crime, and if all the police in the world were after me... there was one man and only one man I could come to.... He would not have made a speech about the good of the industry.... He would not have been mealymouthed or put me aside. He would have hid me under the bed."*

Orson Welles is remembered as the star and director of *Citizen Kane*, considered by many the greatest movie ever made, and as the radio producer and actor who, on Halloween eve, panicked a huge audience with his all-too-realistic broadcast of an invasion of Earth by Martians. European audiences hailed his portrayal of the racketeer Harry Lime in *The Third Man*, but his later years were spent fighting for financing and acting in lesser roles. In a moment of bitterness, he said that his business was "about 2 percent moviemaking and 98 percent hustling."

Darryl F. Zanuck is remembered as the legendary movie producer who began in the silent era with *Rin Tin Tin*, headed production of the first talkie, *The Jazz Singer*, launched Twentieth Century-Fox in the thirties, winning Oscars for *Gentlemen's Agreement, All About Eve*, and, after a six-year series of flops, an Oscar nomination for *The Longest Day*. He was an eccentric and often tyrannical boss; the title of his biography is *Don't Say Yes Until I Finish Talking*. After saving his studio from the disastrous budgetary overruns of *Cleopatra*, he fired his son for financial mismanagement and was himself forced from power a decade before his death.

Welles, a writer as well as a star, delivered this eulogy of Zanuck on December 27, 1979, at the Westwood United Methodist Church in Los Angeles, in the voice that first scared and thrilled radio audiences as "The Shadow" in the 1930s. It begins with a gripping anecdote about Winston Churchill's funeral, for which Churchill wrote the script: in England, noted the film director in his industry's lingo, "they give you the final cut."

The eulogy is notable for what it leaves out. Welles does not recount the movies Zanuck produced or the stars he worked with, as did the []{#part0065.html_page242}obituaries. He dispenses with the deceased's harsh reputation in a few lines: "Darryl didn't sign on to be the recreation director of a summer camp. Of course he was tough.... But unlike many of the others, he was never cruel." He closes on the quality of friendship and personal loyalty in adversity, which both men had and suffered. Unlike many of Zanuck's self-protective corporate peers, testified his friend Welles in a conclusion of seven short, declarative sentences, "He would have hid me under the bed."

\*\*\*

**[AT WINSTON CHURCHILL]{.small}**'s funeral, there was a moment when the coffin was to be carried out of Westminster Abbey and onto a barge for a trip up the Thames River. A special group of pallbearers from the various military services in Great Britain was selected for this. One, a sailor, broke his ankle carrying the coffin down the stone steps of the Abbey. For a moment it seemed that the coffin would drop to the ground, but it was safely carried onto the barge.

Afterward, officials said to the sailor, "How did you manage to go on?"

And the sailor said, "I would have carried him all over London."

That's the way I feel about my friend Darryl Zanuck.

Churchill wrote the script for his own funeral. Lord Mountbatten recently did the same thing in England---in England, if you're going to have a state funeral, they let you do that. They give you what amounts to a final cut. We don't have state funerals in our movie community, but if we did, Darryl would certainly have been given one---and he would have produced it. And what a show that would have been. Virginia and Dick have reminded me that Darryl himself would not wish this occasion to be too lugubrious. That's true. I'm pretty sure that if he was the producer in charge of this occasion, Darryl would have wished for us all to leave this gathering with lightened spirits. The trouble is that I'm the wrong man for that job---I can't find anything cheerful to say about the loss of my friend.

To understand the special nature of his contribution, we must understand the full meaning of the word "producer" in Darryl's day. In the Golden Age of Hollywood, it meant something quite different than it does now. There were producers assigned to each movie, and then there was the man in charge of all the movies. In Darryl's day that was a lot of movies---forty, fifty, sixty, seventy feature pictures a year. He was one of the legendary tycoons presiding over production.

The whole point about Darryl was that he did not just preside. He did so very much more than preside. Of all the big-boss producers, Darryl []{#part0065.html_page243}was unquestionably the man with the greatest gifts---true personal, professional, and artistic gifts for the filmmaking process itself. He began as a writer and in a sense he never stopped functioning as a writer. Others may have matched him as a star maker, but with all of Darryl's flair for the magic personalities, his first commitment was always to the story. For Darryl that was what it was to make a film: to tell a story.

God bless him for that. With half a hundred and more stories to tell every dozen months, this great storyteller was, of necessity, an editor and a great editor. There never was an editor in our business to touch him.

Every great career is a roller coaster and Darryl had his disasters. He knew eclipse. He knew comebacks and triumphs. It was a giant roller coaster. And then there were studio politics, and that's the roughest game there is. But has anybody---anybody---ever claimed that Darryl Zanuck advanced himself by dirty tricks? Or by leaving behind him the usual trail of bloody corpses? Of course, there were some aching egos and some bruised temperaments. If you're in charge of a regiment of artists, some of your commands are going to hurt. Some of your decisions are bound to seem arbitrary, but Darryl didn't sign on to be the recreation director of a summer camp. Of course he was tough. That was his job. But unlike many of the others, he was never cruel. Never vindictive. He wasn't---and what a rare thing it is to say in the competitive game of ours, he was a man totally devoid of malice. But he was great with irony. Great sense of humor, even about himself; of which of the others can we say that?

I always knew that if I did something really outrageous, that if I committed some abominable crime, and if all the police in the world were after me, there was one man and only one man I could come to, and that was Darryl. He would not have made a speech about the good of the industry or the good of his studio. He would not have been mealymouthed or put me aside. He would have hid me under the bed. Very simply, he was a friend. I don't mean just my friend. I mean that friendship was something he was very good at.

And that is why it is so very hard to say good-bye to him.
