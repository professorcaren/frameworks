*"A clear call comes to us today to fight anew under the Jeffersonian banner, with the Jacksonian sword, and in the Wilsonian spirit, and, crashing the gates of privilege, make Jeffersonian democracy a living force again in the lives and homes of men."*

A good keynote address is at once a leisurely evocation of the glory of a partisan past and a brief promise of a glorious future. In the television age, it is also a showcase for a promising young politician, and a party's presentation of what it considers the best image of the party to the public. A keynoter is usually not assigned to deal with the central issue of the time, its key note; rather, it is the orator's job at the start of a gathering of partisans to uplift, exhort, and galvanize the troops.

An example of this kind of keynote address is that of Claude Bowers at the 1928 Democratic National Convention in Houston. That convention nominated Al Smith to face Herbert Hoover, just nominated by the Republicans in Kansas City to succeed Calvin Coolidge. Bowers (1878--1958) was a political columnist for the *New York Journal* and a popular historian, whose best-known works were *The Party Battles of the Jackson Era* and *Jefferson and Hamilton* (he revered Jefferson and despised Hamilton). He later served as FDR's ambassador to Spain during its civil war and to Chile in the 1940s.

The orator associates the Republicans with Hamilton and dissociates them from their Lincoln; he foresees a "plunderbund," or association of predators, if the opposition stays in power; and he makes the coming political contest an Armageddon between the forces of good and evil: "They are led by money-mad cynics and scoffers---and we go forth to battle for the cause of man." It made everybody in the hall feel good.

[]{#part0197.html_page933}**[LADIES AND GENTLEMEN]{.small}** of the Convention:

The American Democracy has mobilized today to wage a war of extermination against privilege and pillage. We prime our guns against autocracy and bureaucracy. We march against that centralization which threatens the liberties of the people. We fight for the republic of the fathers, and for the recovery of the covenant from the keeping of a caste and class. We battle for the honor of the nation, besmirched and bedraggled by the most brazen and shameless carnival of corruption that ever blackened the reputation of a decent and self-respecting people.

We stand for the spirit of the preamble of the Declaration that is made a mockery; for the Bill of Rights that is ignored; for the social and economic justice which is refused; for the sovereign right of states that are denied; and for a return to the old-fashioned civic integrity of a Jackson, a Tilden, a Cleveland, and a Wilson. We stand for the restoration of the government to the people who built it by their bravery and cemented it with their blood....

The issues are as fundamental as they were when Jefferson and Hamilton crossed swords more than a century ago. To understand the conflicting views of these two men on the functions of government is to grasp the deep significance of this campaign.

Now, Hamilton believed in the rule of an aristocracy of money, and Jefferson in a democracy of men.

Hamilton believed that governments are created for the domination of the masses, and Jefferson that they are created for the service of the people.

Hamilton wrote to Morris that governments are strong in proportion as they are made profitable to the powerful; and Jefferson knew that no government is fit to live that does not conserve the interest of the average man.

Hamilton proposed a scheme for binding the wealthy to the government by making government a source of revenue to the wealthy; and Jefferson unfurled his banner of equal rights.

Hamilton would have concentrated authority remote from the people, and Jefferson would have diffused it among them.

Hamilton would have injected governmental activities into all the affairs of men; and Jefferson laid it down as an axiom of freedom that "that government is best which governs least."

Just put a pin in this: there is not a major evil of which the American people are complaining now that is not due to the triumph of the Hamiltonian conception of the state. And the tribute to Hamilton at Kansas City was an expression of fealty to him who thought that governments are strong in proportion as they are made profitable to the powerful; who proposed the plan for binding the wealthy; who devised the []{#part0197.html_page934}scheme to tax the farm to pay the factory; and whose purpose was to make democracy in America a mockery and a sham.

Thus we are challenged once more to a conflict on the fundamentals; and a clear call comes to us today to fight anew under the Jeffersonian banner, with the Jacksonian sword, and in the Wilsonian spirit, and, crashing the gates of privilege, make Jeffersonian democracy a living force again in the lives and homes of men....

You cannot believe with Lincoln in a government "of the people, by the people, and for the people," and with Hamilton in a government of the wealthy, by the influential, and for the powerful.

There are Lincoln Republicans and Hamilton Republicans, but never the twain shall meet....

What a majestic figure was he who led us in those fruitful years! The cold, even light of his superb intellect played upon the most intricate problems of the times, and they seemed to solve themselves. He lifted the people to such heights of moral grandeur as they had never known before; and his name and purpose made hearts beat faster in lowly places where his praise was sung in every language in the world. And when at length, his body broken, but his spirit soaring still, he fell stricken, while still battling for his faith, there passed to time and to eternity and to all mankind the everlasting keeping of the immortal memory of Woodrow Wilson.

We submit that a party that stands for that democracy which is inseparable from the liberties of men, and has given a Jefferson, a Jackson, and a Wilson to the service of mankind, has earned the right, in times like these, to the cooperation of independents and progressives in the struggle for the preservation of popular government, and the purging of the nation of that corruption which has made America a byword and a hissing in the very alleys of the world....

Never in a century has there been such a call to us to battle for the faith of our fathers as there is today; and never has the control of government been so completely concentrated in the hands of a willing caste as now. The dreams of the Hamiltonians have literally come true while the people slept. They wanted organized wealth in possession of the government---and we have it. They wanted the sovereign rights of states denied---and we have it. They wanted bureaucratic agents swarming over the land like the locusts of Egypt---and we have it. They wanted government made profitable to the powerful---and we have it. They wanted, through administration, to make a mockery of democracy---and we have it. The Hamiltonian state is necessarily a temple of gold resting on the bowed back of peasants in other people's fields---and we almost have that now. They would deify dollars and minimize men, limit self-government []{#part0197.html_page935}and centralize power, cripple democracy, empower bureaucracy, welcome plutocracy---and we will soon have that, too.

Give the plunderbund but eight years more of such governmental cooperation, and a combination of power companies will put a few men in control of the public utilities of a mighty empire. Make no mistake about it---that is the great Jacksonian struggle of tomorrow. And with that sinister possibility upon us, the people must determine whether they will entrust their interest to those who believe that governments are strong in proportion as they are made profitable to the powerful or to the Jeffersonians, who believe that governments are created for the service of mankind. Once in possession and entrenched, the plunderbund of the power monopoly cannot be dislodged by the fighting force of a dozen Andrew Jacksons....

We are mobilized to lead the people back to the old paths of constitutional liberty and to the good way. We are going back---back to the old landmarks of liberty and equality when ordinary men had rights that even power respected; when justice, not privilege, was the watchword of the state; when the preamble of the declaration and the bill of rights had meaning; when the nation embraced every section and every class....

Our principles have been written in the triumphs of the people and baptized in the blood of our bravest and our best. Jefferson phrased them, Jackson vitalized them, Wilson applied them, and we go forth to battle for them now.

We face a foe grown arrogant with success. It were infamy to permit the enemy to divide us, or divert us, on the eve of such a battle. Issues are involved that go to the determination of the future of our institutions and our children. The call that comes to us is as sacred as the cause of humanity itself. From the grave at the Hermitage comes the solemn warning that no party ever won or deserved to win that did not organize and fight unitedly for victory---and we shall thus organize and fight. This is a unique campaign....

And we shall win because our cause is just. The predatory forces before us seek a triumph for the sake of the sacking. Their shock troops are the Black Horse Cavalry whose hoofbeats have made hideous music on Pennsylvania Avenue during the last eight years. They are led by money-mad cynics and scoffers---and we go forth to battle for the cause of man. In the presence of such a foe "he who dallies is a dastard and he who doubts is damned." In this convention we close debate and grasp the sword. The time has come. The battle hour has struck. "Then to your tents, O Israel!"
