*"I pity anyone who can't laugh. There must be something wrong with their religion or their lives."*
:::

William Ashley ("Billy") Sunday, the most famous preacher of the early twentieth century, began his extraordinary career in another line of work: playing baseball.

After eight years of major-league play, the baseball star decided to pursue a religious calling and became an ordained minister. In revival meetings around the country, with a tent overhead and sawdust underfoot, Billy Sunday---that was his real name---attracted an audience estimated at a hundred million.

Sunday's typical revival sermon shows his idiomatic language and common-man approach to sermonizing. With direct address and humorous imagery ("a face so long you could eat oatmeal out of the end of a gas pipe"), Sunday testifies to the conversions he has witnessed, a method aimed to bring more converts "to the front."

**[THE TROUBLE WITH]{.small}** many men is that they have got just enough religion to make them miserable. If there is not joy in religion, you have got a leak in your religion. Some haven't religion enough to pay their debts. Would that I might have a hook and for every debt that you left unpaid I might jerk off a piece of clothing. If I did some of you fellows would have not anything on but a celluloid collar and a pair of socks.

Some of you have not got religion enough to have family prayer. Some of you haven't got religion enough to take the beer bottles out of your cellar and throw them in the alley. You haven't got religion enough to tell the proprietor of the red light, "No, you can't rent my house after the first of June"; to tell the saloonkeeper, "You can't have my house when the lease runs out"; and I want to tell you that the man who rents his []{#part0120.html_page500}property to a saloonkeeper is as low-down as the saloonkeeper. The trouble with you is that you are so taken up with business, with politics, with making money, with your lodges, and each and every one is so dependent on the other, that you are scared to death to come out and live \*\*clean-cut for God Almighty.

The matter with a lot of you people is that your religion is not complete. Why, I am almost afraid to make some folks laugh for fear that I will be arrested for breaking a costly piece of antique bric-a-brac.

To see some people you would think that the essential of orthodox Christianity is to have a face so long you could eat oatmeal out of the end of a gas pipe. Sister, that is not religion; I want to tell you that the smiling, happy, sunny-faced religion will win more people to Jesus Christ than the miserable old, grim-faced kind will in ten years.

I pity anyone who can't laugh. There must be something wrong with their religion or their lives. The devil can't laugh.

I have seen women come down the aisle by the thousands, men who drank whisky enough to sink a ship. I see fallen women come to the front by scores and hundreds, and I have seen them go away cleansed by the power of God.

I saw a woman that for twenty-seven years had been proprietor of a disorderly house, and I saw her come down the aisle, close her doors, turn the girls out of her house, to live for God. I saw enough converted in one town where there were four disorderly houses to close their doors; they were empty; the girls have all fled home to their mothers.

Out in Iowa a fellow came to me and spread a napkin on the platform---a napkin as big as a tablecloth. He said, "I want a lot of shavings and sawdust."

"What for?"

"I'll tell you: I want enough to make a sofa pillow. Right here is where I knelt down and was converted, and my wife and four children, and my neighbors. I would like to have enough to make a sofa pillow to have something in the house to help me talk to God. I don't want to forget God, or that I was saved. Can you give me enough?"

I said, "Yes indeed, and if you want to make a mattress, all right, take it; and if you want enough of that tent to make a pair of breeches for all the boys, why take your scissors and cut it right out, if it will help you to keep your mind on God."

That is why I like to have people come down to the front and publicly acknowledge God. I like to have a man have a definite experience in religion---something to remember.
