*"And ain't I a woman? Look at me!"*
:::

Born a slave named Isabella, this American abolitionist received her freedom when New York State emancipated slaves in 1827. She moved to New York City, heard what she believed to be heavenly voices, and took the name Sojourner Truth in 1843, when she quit being a maidservant to become an evangelist. Her opening line was a stunner: "Children, I talk to God and God talks to me!"

Sojourner Truth traveled throughout the North (a "sojourner" stays only temporarily in one place) to spread a message that combined religious and abolitionist ideas. After a despondent speech by Frederick Douglass in 1850, she asked her frequent platform mate a question that still reverberates in theological circles: "Frederick, is God dead?" Although illiterate, this mother of five powerfully conveyed her equal-rights message in dialect, with plain words and commonsense reasoning, drawing on her own experiences to persuade listeners of her sincerity. During the Civil War, President Lincoln appointed her counselor to the freedmen of the capital.

Blacks and women were in competition for suffrage, and few black women attended early women's rights meetings. Sojourner Truth was an exception; at the 1851 Ohio Women's Rights Convention, in Akron, she spoke of feminism with the same fervor that marked her preaching on abolitionism and religion. Through a conversational form of direct address ("Well, children") and the use of repetition (the question "And ain't I a woman?" is raised four times), Sojourner Truth moved listeners in the early days of the fight for women's rights. She said she wanted her language reported in standard English, "not as if I was saying tickety-ump-ump-nicky-nacky," and in some quotation books her "ain'ts" are changed to "aren'ts," but I think such editorial prettification loses the flavor and force of the eloquence.

[]{#part0156.html_page685}**[WELL, CHILDREN, WHERE]{.small}** there is so much racket there must be something out of kilter. I think that 'twixt the Negroes of the South and the women at the North, all talking about rights, the white men will be in a fix pretty soon. But what's all this here talking about?

That man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere. Nobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud puddles, or gives me any best place! And ain't I a woman? Look at me! Look at my arm. I have plowed and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me! And ain't I a woman? I could work as much and eat as much as a man---when I could get it---and bear the lash as well! And ain't I a woman? I have borne thirteen children, and seen them most all sold off to slavery, and when I cried out with my mother's grief, none but Jesus heard me! And ain't I a woman?

Then they talk about this thing in the head; what's this they call it? \[Intellect, someone whispers.\] That's it, honey. What's that got to do with women's rights or Negro's rights? If my cup won't hold but a pint, and yours holds a quart, wouldn't you be mean not to let me have my little half-measure full?

Then that little man in black there, he says women can't have as much rights as men, 'cause Christ wasn't a woman! Where did your Christ come from? Where did your Christ come from? From God and a woman! Man had nothing to do with him.

If the first woman God ever made was strong enough to turn the world upside down all alone, these women together ought to be able to turn it back, and get it right side up again! And now they is asking to do it, the men better let them.

Obliged to you for hearing me, and now old Sojourner ain't got nothing more to say.
