*"Three hundred thousand little girls, from whose labor, if we only deduct two hours a day, away goes the wealth, away goes the capital, away go the resources, the power, and the glory of England!"*

Cobbett, who used the pseudonym Peter Porcupine, was the first media giant. He attacked the army establishment in England and was driven to America to escape prosecution; in Philadelphia, he supported the despised King George III and was hit with the largest libel judgment yet levied in America; returning to England, he turned on the government there and was jailed for libel. Yet, wherever Cobbett wrote, []{#part0187.html_page886}his iconoclastic prose was widely read by commoners, and his vigorous diatribes and denunciations marshaled the force of public opinion as never before. Essayist William Hazlitt marveled at Cobbett's patriotism of contrariety and coined a phrase that has been applied to journalism ever since: "One has no notion of him as making use of a fine pen, but a great mutton-fist; his style stuns his readers.... He is a kind of *fourth estate* in the politics of the country."

The lifelong agitator was elected to Parliament in 1833, and he covered his own speeches in his *Political Register*. One bill he supported was to reduce the long hours of girls under eighteen working in factories; he recounted the triumph of the mill owners in his reform journal:

"The debate was closing at half-after twelve; and the main argument of the opponents was that if two hours' labor from these children, under eighteen years of age, were taken off, the consequences, on a *national scale*, might be 'truly dreadful'! It might, and would, destroy manufacturing capital; prevent us from carrying on competition with foreign manufacturers; reduce mills to a small part of their present value; and break up, as it were, the wealth and power of the country; render it comparatively feeble; and expose it to be an easy prey to foreign nations. What I said, was that which here follows, as near as I can recollect, word for word."

**[SIR, I WILL]{.small}** make but one single observation upon this subject; and that is this: that this "*reformed*" House has, this night, made a *discovery* greater than all the discoveries that all former Houses of Commons have ever made, even if all their discoveries could have been put into one. Heretofore, we have sometimes been told that our ships, our mercantile traffic with foreign nations by the means of those ships, together with our body of rich merchants; we have sometimes been told that these form the source of our wealth, power, and security, At other times, the land has stepped forward, and bid us look to it, and its yeomanry, as the sure and solid foundation of our greatness and our safety, At other times, the bank has pushed forward with her claims, and has told us that great as the others were, they were nothing without "*public credit*," upon which not only the prosperity and happiness but the very independence of the country depended. But, sir, we have this night discovered that the shipping, the land, and the bank and its credit are all nothing worth compared with the labor of three hundred thousand little girls in Lancashire! Aye, when compared with only an eighth part of the labor of those three hundred thousand little girls, from whose labor, if we only deduct two []{#part0187.html_page887}hours a day, away goes the wealth, away goes the capital, away go the resources, the power, and the glory of England! With what pride and what pleasure, sir, will the right honorable gentleman opposite and the honorable member for Manchester behind me go northward with the news of this discovery, and communicate it to that large portion of the little girls whom they have the honor and the happiness to represent!
