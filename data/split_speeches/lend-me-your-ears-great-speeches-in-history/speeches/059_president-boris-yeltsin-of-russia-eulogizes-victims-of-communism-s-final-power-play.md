*"Forgive me, your president, that I could not defend, could not save your sons..."*

Sometimes an occasion makes a speech. Boris Yeltsin, long treated by Western leaders and media as a buffoon for his heckling of Mikhail Gorbachev's "half-measures" of reform, surged to prominence atop a tank resisting a coup attempt by Communist hard-liners. During that abortive military-KGB putsch in August of 1991, three young Russians were killed in the popular resistance; to capitalize on the emotion of the moment, and to rally opinion to pulverize the still-entrenched Communist apparat, a state funeral was held and nationally telecast; religious leaders conducted services, further identifying the reformers with the pre-Communist culture (including prayers in rarely heard Hebrew, because one of the dead heroes, Ilya Krichevsky, was a Jew).

Gorbachev, on that August 24, announced to the crowd that he had decreed that the three dead men would be declared heroes of the Soviet Union, a central entity he was eager to save, and referred to the coup plotters only with "They won't be pardoned." Yeltsin spoke ten times of Russia, and used a powerful figure of speech to describe the fallen-out coup leaders: "like cockroaches in a bottle, trying to eat each other." Gorbachev began his speech, "Dear Muscovites!" Yeltsin began more somberly and personally:

\*\*\*

**[DEAR RELATIVES AND]{.small}** loved ones of Dmitri Komar, Vladimir Usov, and Ilya Krichevsky, dear fellow countrymen and Muscovites:

Today many millions of Muscovites, the whole of Russia, are parting with our heroes, with our defenders, with our saviors. Of course, we are not parting with their names forever, because from now on their names are sacred names for Russia, for all the people of our long-suffering Russia.

[]{#part0067.html_page250}When television and radio reported about the coup on Monday, the hearts of millions and millions of mothers and fathers trembled most of all because they were scared for their children. Because it was young people, it was our children, who more than anyone else rushed to defend Russia's honor, its freedom, its independence, and its democracy, to defend its parliament.

Yes, from now on, this square, on which a battle raged for three days, on which tens of thousands of Muscovites kept vigil, will be called the Square of Free Russia.

The enemy is cruel and, of course, bloodthirsty, especially when he knows that if he loses no one will take him in. All the participants, all the main participants of the putsch, are arrested. Criminal proceedings have been started against them, and I am sure that they will be made to answer for everything.

But even today, how cynical the words of arrested \[the former head of the KGB, Vladimir A.\] Kryuchkov sound, the man who yesterday said that if he could do it over again he would have started a little faster and more energetically, and that the most important thing was to behead Russia.

This entire plot, and we must understand this very clearly, was aimed in the first place against Russia, its parliament, its government, its president. But all of Russia stood up to its defense: Moscow, Leningrad, the Urals, the Far East, the Kuzbass, practically all regions of the republic, although there were some regions which immediately put up banners and slogans expressing loyalty to the Extraordinary Committee. These officials already have been dismissed from their posts. And the prosecutor's office is considering their cases.

But we cannot resurrect those who died at the walls of our White House. We pay tribute to their courage, those who have become Heroes of the Soviet Union in death. I bow down to the mothers and fathers of Dmitri, Volodya, and Ilya, and I express to them my deep condolences, and to all their relatives and loved ones. Forgive me, your president, that I could not defend, could not save your sons.

In this day of Russia's national mourning, we, of course, need to strengthen our unity to energetically act further. We have cleared ourselves a path. Our deceased heroes have helped us to do so. This is a difficult day for us, a hard day. But it could have been even worse, because the enemies are already like cockroaches in a bottle, trying to eat each other. They are pointing fingers at each other, asking who played a more important role in the plot, revealing to each other the lists of people they wanted to kill first, second, third, fourth.

[]{#part0067.html_page251}Only the first twelve victims in these lists were designated to be killed at 6 [P.M]{.small}. on August 19 during the storming of the House of Soviets. So it was not in vain the Muscovites were here, defending the honor of Russia.

It was a difficult loss, and the memory of it will be with us forever. For that reason, our heroes, sleep peacefully and let the earth be soft for you.
