*"Therefore, my little sisters, beware of the sin of ingratitude...."*
:::

Baptized as John in 1182, this saint became known as Francis of Assisi from his nickname of Francesco, "the Frenchman." Although he was born in Assisi, a town in central Italy, his mother's family was of French descent, and he knew some French as well as Latin.

When he was twenty-three, Francis sought a military career. He intended to join an army supporting the pope's cause in southeastern Italy, but he became ill at Spoleto and never reached the fighting. While ill, he received a "heavenly visitation," a voice in a dream asking him, "Why do you desert the Lord for his vassal?"

After serving as a repairer of run-down churches and a nurse of lepers, Francis started a religious order dedicated to a strict renunciation of the material values of this world and a literal adherence to the Christian Gospel. His followers numbered only eleven in 1209, but his joyous preaching and asceticism increased the numbers a decade later to more than five thousand. This was the ebullient message attributed to him: "Lord, make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; and where there is sadness, joy."

The faith of Francis in the brotherhood of men and nature led him to preach the Gospel, or "good news," to all of God's creatures, great and small. In this sermon, his personification of birds as "my little sisters" introduces the evidence of God's love for them and, by extension, argues the need for a human posture of gratefulness toward the Creator.

**[MY LITTLE SISTERS]{.small}**, the birds, much bounden are ye unto God, your creator, and always in every place ought ye to praise him, for that he hath given you liberty to fly about everywhere, and hath also given you double and triple raiment; moreover he preserved your seed in the []{#part0109.html_page460}ark of Noah, that your race might not perish out of the world; still more are ye beholden to him for the element of the air which he hath appointed for you; beyond all this, ye sow not, neither do you reap; and God feedeth you, and giveth you the streams and fountains for your drink; the mountains and the valleys for your refuge and the high trees whereon to make your nests; and because ye know not how to spin or sew, God clotheth you, you and your children; wherefore your Creator loveth you much, seeing that he hath bestowed on you so many benefits; and therefore, my little sisters, beware of the sin of ingratitude, and study always to give praises unto God.
