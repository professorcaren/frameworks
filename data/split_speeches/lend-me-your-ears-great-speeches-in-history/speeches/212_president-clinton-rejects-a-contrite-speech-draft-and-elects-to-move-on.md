Rarely do we have the opportunity to consider the choice of speeches before a president at a critical moment in his life.

On August 17, 1998, President Bill Clinton, under threat of subpoena, appeared before a federal grand jury impaneled by Independent Counsel Ken Starr to answer questions about whether he lied under oath during a deposition in a civil suit brought by Paula Corbin Jones charging sexual harassment. Though denying that he committed perjury, Clinton admitted having had an "inappropriate sexual relationship" with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern.

Assuming that intense media interest would crack through grand jury secrecy, the president decided to make the admission himself directly to the U.S. public. Most political observers friendly to the president and some White House aides expected that short, nationally televised speech to be contrite; by frankly apologizing, they felt that he could rely on the forgiveness in the American psyche (and in enough members of the House of Representatives) to be able to leave the subject behind. A speech draft was submitted to pursue that ameliorating course.

But the president was profoundly angered by the unrelenting nature of the questioning before the grand jury. He did not merely edit the "soft" alternative; rather, on short notice, Mr. Clinton with some help from aides wrote an entirely different speech. Gone was the word "remorse." Though he did not flinch from characterizing his conduct as "wrong," he charged that the original Jones lawsuit was politically motivated and noted that the independent counsel's investigation was itself under investigation. Rather than demean himself by asking forgiveness, the president asked his viewers to "turn away from the spectacle of the past []{#part0231.html_page1140}seven months." The undelivered contrite draft concluded with "God bless you, and good night"; the speech as given ended more formally: "Thank you for watching, and good night."

As some on his staff anticipated, the defiant speech was not well received. But the Clinton counterpunch had the advantage of coming straight from the shoulder; though it contributed to the House impeachment, it did not lead to a Senate conviction. From the speechwriting point of view, both addresses were crafted excellently, providing us with an example of different ways to deal with the same crisis.

**[MY FELLOW AMERICANS]{.small}**:

No one who is not in my position can understand the remorse I feel today. Since I was very young, I have had a profound reverence for this office I hold. I've been honored that you, the people, have entrusted it to me. I am proud of what we have accomplished together.

But in this case, I have fallen short of what you should expect from a president. I have failed my own religious faith and values. I have let too many people down. I take full responsibility for my actions---for hurting my wife and daughter, for hurting Monica Lewinsky and her family, for hurting friends and staff, and for hurting the country I love. None of this ever should have happened.

I never should have had any sexual contact with Monica Lewinsky, but I did. I should have acknowledged that I was wrong months ago, but I didn't. I thought I was shielding my family, but I know in the end, for Hillary and Chelsea, delay has only brought more pain. Their forgiveness and love, expressed so often as we sat alone together this weekend, means more than I can ever say.

What I did was wrong---and there is no excuse for it. I do want to assure you, as I told the grand jury under oath, that I did nothing to obstruct this investigation.

[]{#part0231.html_page1141}Finally, I also want to apologize to all of you, my fellow citizens. I hope you can find it in your heart to accept that apology. I pledge to you that I will make every effort of mind and spirit to earn your confidence again, to be worthy of this office, and to finish the work on which we have made such remarkable progress in the past six years. God bless you, and good night.

**[GOOD EVENING.]{.small}**

This afternoon in this room, from this chair, I testified before the Office of Independent Counsel and the grand jury. I answered their questions truthfully, including questions about my private life---questions no American citizen would ever want to answer. Still, I must take complete responsibility for all my actions, both public and private. And that is why I am speaking to you tonight.

As you know, in a deposition in January, I was asked questions about my relationship with Monica Lewinsky. While my answers were legally accurate, I did not volunteer information. Indeed, I did have a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was not appropriate. In fact, it was wrong. It constituted a critical lapse in judgment and a personal failure on my part for which I am solely and completely responsible. But I told the grand jury today---and I say to you now---that at no time did I ask anyone to lie, to hide or destroy evidence, or to take any other unlawful action.

I know that my public comments and my silence about this matter gave a false impression. I misled people, including even my wife. I deeply regret that. I can only tell you I was motivated by many factors. First, by a desire to protect myself from the embarrassment of my own conduct.

I was also very concerned about protecting my family. The fact that these questions were being asked in a politically inspired lawsuit, which has since been dismissed, was a consideration, too.

In addition, I had real and serious concerns about an independent counsel investigation that began with private business dealings twenty years ago---dealings, I might add, about which an independent federal agency found no evidence of any wrongdoing by me or my wife over two years ago. The independent counsel investigation moved on to my staff and friends, then into my private life. And now the investigation itself is under investigation.

This has gone on too long, cost too much, and hurt too many innocent people. Now, this matter is between me, the two people I love most---my wife and our daughter---and our God.

I must put it right, and I am prepared to do whatever it takes to do so. Nothing is more important to me personally. But it is private, and I intend to reclaim my family life for my family. It's nobody's business but ours. Even presidents have private lives. It is time to stop the pursuit of personal destruction and the prying into private lives and get on with our national life.

Our country has been distracted by this matter for too long, and I take []{#part0231.html_page1142}my responsibility for my part in all of this. That is all I can do. Now it is time---in fact, it is past time---to move on. We have important work to do, real opportunities to seize, real problems to solve, real security matters to face.

And so tonight, I ask you to turn away from the spectacle of the past seven months, to repair the fabric of our national discourse, and to return our attention to all the challenges and all the promise of the next American century.

Thank you for watching, and good night.
