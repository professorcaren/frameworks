# Presidential Aide Jack Valenti Recalls the Lessons Learned at the Center of Power {#part0148.html_c134 .toc}

*"I learned never to humiliate an antagonist and never desert a friend.... I learned that... the politician who persistently lifts his wet finger to test the political polls before he acts usually leaves office with a wet finger."*

A World War II combat hero from Texas, Jack Valenti founded an advertising agency in Houston in 1952 and became associated with the political campaigns of Lyndon Baines Johnson. Valenti was in charge of the press during the visit to Texas of President Kennedy and Vice-President Johnson on November 22, 1963; when the president was assassinated in the Dallas motorcade, Valenti accompanied the new president []{#part0148.html_page635}to Washington in Air Force One, the first special assistant named by President Johnson.

In later years, as Johnson was vilified by the Left for the war in Vietnam and by the Right for his Great Society, Valenti remained outspokenly loyal to his old chief, often the only voice that could be found for a spirited defense of LBJ's record and reputation. An articulate and forceful speaker, the diminutive Democrat---who left the White House to become president and CEO of the Motion Picture Association of America---wrote the best book about speechmaking, *Speak Up with Confidence*. He is a founder-member of the Judson Welliver Society, the association of White House speechwriters.

In this speech to the Federal Communications Bar Association, made in Washington on January 31, 1996, thirty years after becoming the movie industry's voice, Valenti reflected on the lessons learned in a career in or near the center of power.

The talk opens with the briefest of references to the dramatic moment he came to Washington, which was just enough; it moves to a series of paragraphs beginning "I learned that," giving the address a disciplined structure; and it concludes with a dramatic anecdote illustrating his major "lesson." Needless to say, the well-crafted speech by the Harvard-educated political pro was flawlessly delivered in a modified Texas accent.

**[...I WOULD LIKE]{.small}** to talk tonight about what I have learned since I arrived in the Federal City aboard Air Force One on November 22, 1963.... I learned that in the White House there is one enduring standard by which every assistant to the president, every presidential adviser, every presidential consultant, must inevitably be measured. Not whether you went to Harvard or Yale, or whether you scored sixteen hundred on your SATs, or whether you are endlessly charming and charismatically enabled, or whether you made millions in what we sardonically call "the private sector." These are all attractive credentials, which one may wear modestly or otherwise. But when the decision crunch is on in the Oval Office they are all merely tracings on dry leaves in the wind. What does count, the ultimate and only gauge, is whether you have "good Judgment."

I learned that no presidential decision is ever made where the president had all the information he needed to make the decision. There is never enough facts. Very quickly, the decision corridor grows dark, the mapping indistinct, the exit inaccessible. What is not useful are precedents []{#part0148.html_page636}or learned disquisitions by op-ed page pundits, some of whom would be better suited to raising pigeons....

It is well to remember, as Oscar Wilde once said, that from time to time nothing that is worth knowing can be taught. Judgment is something that springs from some little elf who inhabits an area between your belly and your brain, and who, from time to time, tugs at your nerve edges, and says, "No, not that way, the other way."...

I learned that the one political component above all else which can ensure electoral victory or crushing defeat is timing. A whack to your political solar plexus six to eight months before an election is survivable. Two weeks before the election, and you're dead. Ask Jimmy Carter. In politics, twenty hours is a millennium.

I learned that economic forecasts beyond about two weeks have the same odds of accuracy as guessing the winning numbers in the D.C. lottery....

Economic forecasts are usually unwarranted assumptions leaping to a preconceived conclusion. Just remember, whenever an economist can't remember his phone number, he will give you an estimate.

I learned that when there is no unamiable issue like war, or prospect of war, or recession, or economic disaster, most people vote for a president viscerally, not intellectually. Most people choose a president romantically, a choice made in unfathomable ways, which is how romance is formed. Like John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.

I learned never to humiliate an antagonist and never desert a friend. In a political struggle, never get personal else the dagger digs too deep. Your enemy today may need to be your ally tomorrow.

I learned that nothing lasts. What is up will inevitably go down and sooner or later in reverse. It took forty years, but the House changed masters. Victory is often the prelude to defeat. President Bush can rise to testify about that. Failure is often the precursor of triumph. Ask Bill Clinton. Richard Nixon tasted both ends of those beguiling equations. The breeding ground of politics is irrigated and nourished by change. As one who has fallen from political power, I can instruct George Stephanopoulos in how quickly you lose your charm and your enticements when you no longer sit at the right hand of the Sun King.

I learned that a political poll is Janus in disguise. The life of a poll is about ten nanoseconds. It is already in decay when it is published. A political poll, like the picture of Dorian Gray, is the face of entropy. The veteran professionals know that. The old pols use polls to raise money. When polls are up, go for the fat wallets. But the politician who persistently []{#part0148.html_page637}lifts his wet finger to test the political polls before he acts usually leaves office with a wet finger....

But the greatest lesson I have learned, the most important of my education, is really the essential imperative of this century. It is called leadership. We brandish the word. We admire its light. But we seldom define it. Outside Caen in the Normandy countryside of France is a little cemetery. Atop one of the graves is a cross on which is etched these words: "Leadership is wisdom and courage and a great carelessness of self." Which means, of course, that leaders must from time to time put to hazard their own political future in order to do what is right in the long-term interests of those they have by solemn oath sworn to serve. Easy to say. Tough to do.

I remember when I first bore personal witness to its doing. It was in December 1963. Lyndon Johnson had been president but a few short weeks. At that time I was actually living on the third floor of the White House until my family arrived. The president said to me on a Sunday morning, "Call Dick Russell and ask him if he would come by for coffee with you and me."

Senator Richard Brevard Russell of Georgia was the single most influential and honored figure in the Senate. His prestige towered over all others in those years before the dialogue turned sour and mean. When in 1952, the Senate Democratic leader's post fell open, the other senators turned immediately to Russell, imploring him to take the job. "No," said Russell, "let's make Lyndon Johnson our leader, he'll do just fine." So at the age of forty-four, just four years in his first Senate term, LBJ became the youngest ever Democratic leader and in a short time the greatest parliamentary commander in Senate history.

When Russell arrived, the president greeted him warmly with a strong embrace, the six-foot-four LBJ and the smallish, compact Russell, with his gleaming bald head and penetrating eyes. The president steered him to the couch overlooking the Rose Garden in the West Hall on the second floor of the mansion. I sat next to Russell. The president was in his wing chair, his knees almost touching Russell's, so close did they sit.

The president drew even closer, and said in an even voice, "Dick, I love you and I owe you. If it had not been for you I would not have been leader, or vice-president, or now president. But I wanted to tell you face to face, please don't get in my way on this civil rights bill, which has been locked up in the Senate too damn long. I intend to pass this bill, Dick. I will not cavil. I will not hesitate. And if you get in my way, I'll run you down."

[]{#part0148.html_page638}Russell sat mutely for a moment, impassive, his face a mask. Then he spoke, in the rolling accents of his Georgia countryside. "Well, Mr. President, you may just do that. But I pledge you that if you do, it will not only cost you the election, it will cost you the South forever."

President Johnson in all the later years in which I knew him so intimately never made me prouder than he did that Sunday morning so long, long ago. He touched Russell lightly on the shoulder, an affectionate gesture of one loving friend to another. He spoke softly, almost tenderly: "Dick, my old friend, if that's the price I have to pay, then I will gladly pay it."

Of all the lessons I have learned in my political life, that real-life instruction in leadership on a Sunday morning in the White House was the most elemental, and the most valuable. It illuminated in a blinding blaze the highest point to which the political spirit can soar. I have never forgotten it. I never will.
