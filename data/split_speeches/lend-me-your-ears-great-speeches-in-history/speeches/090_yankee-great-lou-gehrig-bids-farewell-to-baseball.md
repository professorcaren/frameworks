# Yankee Great Lou Gehrig Bids Farewell to Baseball {#part0101.html_c90 .toc}

*"I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth."*
:::

On July 4, 1939, Lou Gehrig stood before a crowd of more than sixty thousand fans in Yankee Stadium to bid farewell to a game in which he'd become legendary. Within two years of that tearful speech, the baseball great was dead of a paralyzing disease that still bears his name.

In spite of the fatal ailment, however, the "Iron Horse" heroically spoke in 1939 of his great fortune in teammates and family. As first baseman of the New York Yankees, Gehrig had played 2,130 consecutive games, a major-league record; with a career batting average of .340, he became known as the Pride of the Yankees.

The emotion of his farewell speech wells up in this direct address to his fans, particularly in the repeated assertion of "Sure, I'm lucky."

[]{#part0101.html_page424}**[FANS, FOR THE]{.small}** past two weeks you have been reading about a bad break I got. Yet today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth. I have been in ballparks for seventeen years and have never received anything but kindness and encouragement from you fans.

Look at these grand men. Which of you wouldn't consider it the highlight of his career just to associate with them for even one day?

Sure, I'm lucky. Who wouldn't consider it an honor to have known Jacob Ruppert; also the builder of baseball's greatest empire, Ed Barrow; to have spent six years with that wonderful little fellow Miller Huggins; then to have spent the next nine years with that outstanding leader, that smart student of psychology---the best manager in baseball today---Joe McCarthy!

Sure, I'm lucky. When the New York Giants, a team you would give your right arm to beat, and vice versa, sends you a gift, that's something! When everybody down to the groundskeepers and those boys in white coats remember you with trophies, that's something.

When you have a wonderful mother-in-law who takes sides with you in squabbles against her own daughter, that's something. When you have a father and mother who work all their lives so that you can have an education and build your body, it's a blessing! When you have a wife who has been a tower of strength and shown more courage than you dreamed existed, that's the finest I know.

So I close in saying that I might have had a tough break; but I have an awful lot to live for!
