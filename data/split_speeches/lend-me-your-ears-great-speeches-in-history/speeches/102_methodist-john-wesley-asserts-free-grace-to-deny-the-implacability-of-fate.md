*"God is not divided against himself."*
:::

Before becoming the Father of Methodism, John Wesley was ordained a deacon at the age of twenty-two and a priest at twenty-five in the Church of England. It was not until he was thirty-four, however, at a religious society in Aldersgate Street, London, that he experienced the famous conversion in which he felt his "heart strangely warmed": "I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone, for salvation, and an assurance was given me that he had given away my sins."

That assurance led Wesley to pursue his evangelism with unparalleled enthusiasm in "field preaching," taking the message outside the churches and onto the fields and highways. By one accounting, Wesley preached more than forty thousand sermons and traveled farther than 200,000 miles on horseback; statues of him today at Methodist institutions often show him on a horse.

In what may be his greatest sermon, Wesley questioned the entire doctrine of predestination. On a field near Bristol, England, on April 29, 1739, he preached against this notion and sought to replace it with the concept of "free grace," the love of God that is "free in all, and free for all."

Wesley uses ancient images ("weeping crocodile tears") and scriptural references to press the logic of his argument, enumerating and linking each step of the thought process that led him to deny predestination. For instance, the simple repetition of the adjective "uncomfortable" draws together the third and fourth points of the sermon, just as the anaphora of "It does not depend on..." introduces a listing of the many conditions previously held to be the sources of God's grace.

---Romans 8:32

\*\*\*

**[HOW FREELY DOES]{.small}** God love the world! While we were yet sinners, "Christ died for the ungodly." While we were "dead in sin," God "spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all." And how freely with him does he "give us all things!" Verily, *free grace* is all in all!

The grace or love of God, whence cometh our salvation, is *free in all*, and *free for all*.

First: it is free *in all* to whom it is given. It does not depend on any power or merit in man; no, not in any degree, neither in whole, not in part. It does not in any wise depend either on the good works or righteousness of the receiver---not on anything he has done or anything he is. It does not depend on his endeavors. It does not depend on his good tempers, or good desires, or good purposes and intentions; for all these flow from the free grace of God; they are the streams only, not the fountain. They are the fruits of free grace, and not the root. They are not the cause but the effects of it. Whatsoever good is in man, or is done by man, God is the author and doer of it. Thus is his grace free in all; that is, no way depending on any power or merit in man, but on God alone, who freely gave us his own Son, and "with him freely giveth us all things."

But is it free *for all* as well as *in all*? To this some have answered, "No, it is free only for those whom God hath ordained to life; and they are but a little flock. The greater part of mankind God hath ordained to death; and it is not free for them. Them God hateth; and therefore, before they were born, decreed they should die eternally. And this he absolutely decreed; because so was his good pleasure; because it was his sovereign will. Accordingly, they are born for this, to be destroyed body and soul in hell. And they grow up under the irrevocable curse of God, without any possibility of redemption; for what grace God gives he gives only for this, to increase, not prevent, their damnation...."

But if this be so, then is all preaching vain. It is needless to them that are elected; for they, whether with preaching or without, will infallibly be saved. Therefore, the end of preaching, to save souls, is void with regard to them. And it is useless to them that are not elected, for they cannot possibly be saved. They, whether with preaching or without, will infallibly be damned. The end of preaching is therefore void with regard to them likewise; so that in either case our preaching is vain, as your hearing is also vain.

This, then, is a plain proof that the doctrine of predestination is not a []{#part0114.html_page478}doctrine of God, because it makes void the ordinance of God: and God is not divided against himself. A second is that it directly tends to destroy that holiness which is the end of all the ordinances of God....

Thirdly, this doctrine tends to destroy the comfort of religion, the happiness of Christianity. This is evident as to all those who believe themselves to be reprobated, or who only suspect or fear it. All the great and precious promises are lost to them; they afford them no ray of comfort: for they are not the elect of God: therefore, they have neither lot nor portion in them. This is an effectual bar to their finding any comfort or happiness, even in that religion whose ways are designed to be "ways of pleasantness, and all her paths peace...."

Again: how uncomfortable a thought is this, that thousands and millions of men, without any preceding offense or fault of theirs, were unchangeably doomed to everlasting burnings! How peculiarly uncomfortable must it be to those who have put on Christ! To those who, being filled with bowels of mercy, tenderness, and compassion, could even "wish themselves accursed for their brethren's sake"!

Fourthly: this uncomfortable doctrine directly tends to destroy our zeal for good works. And this it does, first, as it naturally tends (according to what was observed before) to destroy our love to the greater part of mankind, namely, the evil and unthankful. For whatever lessens our love must so far lessen our desire to do them good....

But, fifthly, this doctrine not only tends to destroy Christian holiness, happiness, and good works, but hath also a direct and manifest tendency to overthrow the whole Christian revelation....

You represent him as mocking his helpless creatures by offering what he never intends to give. You describe him as saying one thing and meaning another; as pretending the love which he had not. Him, in "whose mouth was no guile," you make full of deceit, void of common sincerity---then especially, when, drawing nigh the city, he wept over it and said, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how oft *would I* have gathered thy children together---and *ye would not*." Now, if you say, *they would*, but *he would not*, you represent him (which who could hear?) as weeping crocodile tears: weeping over the prey which himself had doomed to destruction!...

This is the blasphemy clearly contained in *the horrible decree* of predestination! And here I fix my foot. On this I join issue with every assertor of it. You represent God as worse than the devil---more false, more cruel, more unjust....

[]{#part0114.html_page479}Oh, hear ye this, ye that forget God! Ye cannot charge your death upon him! "Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord God" (Ezekiel 18:23, etc.). "Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed... for why will ye die, O house of Israel? For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord God: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye." "As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked.... Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?"
