*"When all other friends desert, he remains."*
:::

George Graham Vest, a member of the Confederate Congress during the Civil War, served as U.S. senator from Missouri from 1879 to 1903. He was a leading debater, inveighed at length against the "menace" of Mormonism, and could claim as his hometown the oxymoronic Sweet Springs in Saline County, Missouri.

He is remembered for a speech he made as a young lawyer in Georgetown, Missouri, and repeated hundreds of times around the country throughout his life. He was representing a plaintiff who sued a neighbor for the killing of his dog. He paid little attention to his own client's charges, or to the testimony of the defendant; instead, he waited for his turn to address the jury and won the case unfairly by wringing its heart with an emotional evocation of the fidelity of dogs in general.

It is a great short speech. The logician may dismiss it as the rankest sentimentalism, and the cool intellectual may object to its shameless tear-jerking, but the rhetorician is prepared to lick the orator's hand.

The theme is fidelity. The first paragraph, with its half dozen uses of "may," sets forth the conditional nature of human affection, preparing for the coming contrast; the second paragraph slams home the unconditional faithfulness of the dog. (He focuses on the male dog because "he" is more personal than "it" or "they"; in my own experience, the bitch is more faithful.) The final paragraph is hearts and flowers---"the violin," as newsmagazine writers call lyrical thematic essays---but despite Vest's clichés about "the last scene of all" and "the cold ground," the picture of fidelity at the graveside induces a lump in the throat of the listener every time. If there has ever been a good dog in your life, read this with a handkerchief handy; your eyes will begin to well up at "He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer...."

[]{#part0049.html_page191}**[GENTLEMEN OF THE]{.small}** jury:

The best friend a man has in the world may turn against him and become his enemy. His son or daughter that he has reared with loving care may prove ungrateful. Those who are nearest and dearest to us, those whom we trust with our happiness and our good name may become traitors to their faith. The money that a man has, he may lose. It flies away from him, perhaps when he needs it most. A man's reputation may be sacrificed in a moment of ill-considered action. The people who are prone to fall on their knees to do us honor when success is with us may be the first to throw the stone of malice when failure settles its cloud upon our heads.

The one absolutely unselfish friend that man can have in this selfish world, the one that never deserts him, the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous is his dog. A man's dog stands by him in prosperity and in poverty, in health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground, where the wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely, if only he may be near his master's side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer; he will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounter with the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a prince. When all other friends desert, he remains. When riches take wings, and reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in his love as the sun in its journey through the heavens.

If fortune drives the master forth an outcast in the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher privilege than that of accompanying him, to guard him against danger, to fight against his enemies. And when the last scene of all comes, and death takes his master in its embrace and his body is laid away in the cold ground, no matter if all other friends pursue their way, there by the graveside will the noble dog be found, his head between his paws, his eyes sad, but open in alert watchfulness, faithful and true even in death.
