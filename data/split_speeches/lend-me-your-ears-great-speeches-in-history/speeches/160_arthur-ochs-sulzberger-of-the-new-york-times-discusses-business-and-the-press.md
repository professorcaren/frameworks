*"Fifty years ago, an American president could say, with much justification, that 'the business of America is business.' We've gone beyond that. The business of America is freedom."*
:::

Punch Sulzberger---so nicknamed by his grandfather Adolph Ochs, first successful publisher of the *New York Times*, as counterpoint to his sister, Judy---was president and publisher of the newspaper and its related publications and broadcasting stations from 1963 to 1992, when he retired as publisher, continuing as chairman and chief executive officer. A former marine, he made the decision to publish the Pentagon Papers in 1971; in the firestorm that followed, he said, "We gave away no national secrets. We didn't jeopardize any American soldiers or marines overseas. These papers are a part of history."

In his lifetime at the *Times*, he was more businessman than reporter; on March 14, 1977, he spoke to the Detroit Economic Club at a time when many corporate executives were persuading themselves that journalism was printing more bad news about business than good. His theme was "Is the press antibusiness?" and, remembering his reporting days, he put the story in the lead.

\*\*\*

**[IT'S GOOD TO]{.small}** be here in Detroit, the home of the "Big Two"---the *Detroit News* and the *Detroit Free Press*. About a year ago, I was looking through a newspaper, and I came across a story that gave me my topic for today: Is the press antibusiness?

The story that triggered that question in my mind was a report of the dreary 1975 earnings of the New York Times Company.

Happily, I can address that question today in a more objective frame of mind. The 1976 figures, as reported in the paper, show circulation, []{#part0176.html_page813}advertising, and earnings on a satisfying march upward. The article about it looked decidedly probusiness. In fact, I cannot recall a morning on which I read the *Wall Street Journal* with greater pleasure.

Is the press antibusiness? That question breeds another: How can the press be antibusiness when the press is business, and often big business at that? After all, like many of you in the room today, we, too, face boards of directors, union leaders, the EEOC, the SEC, and stockholders. It's hard to remember a *Times* annual meeting which Evelyn Y. Davis missed.

But the fact that the press is often big business itself does not really enable us to duck the question: Are we antibusiness? A great many businessmen suggest that a new tone is creeping into journalism. They find that the big corporation *too* is often portrayed as the villain and the consumer movement the hero; that bad news is reported with glee, and good corporate news is relayed grudgingly; that the profit motive is *derogated* by writers who seem to prefer more government control and, at best, have little or no training in the world of finance. Too often they feel the deadline conflicts with accuracy, and the deadline too often wins. It is argued that a general public distrust of institutions is being *focused* by the media into a lack of confidence in all American business enterprise.

Let me pass along a tip on how to detect bias in any speaker on this subject. If he talks about "the media," he's against us; if he talks about "the press," he's for us. I speak to you today as a member of the press.

Let me grant this at the outset: press coverage of business has changed and is still changing. A more analytical---a more skeptical, sometimes more critical---approach is being taken. And this is not only true with business reporting; government, education, the courts, and the press itself are subject to this new scrutiny.

The printing of handouts---or "editing with a shovel"---is on the decline, and that's good.

But why, journalists are asked, don't we play up the good news? Why does the corporate bribe or the drop in earnings get the big headline---while the advance in technology or the rise in earnings gets buried?

One answer, of course, is in the nature of news: we give more space to a plane crash than to a report on the thousands of safe landings made every day. I would never suggest that "good news is no news," but I would suggest that bad news is often big news.

Another answer is in the changing nature of the news business. In every field, editors are emphasizing two basic questions. One is *How*? How will this affect the reader's life? And newspapers respond with more service columns, more pieces on personal investing, and more columns on the significance of business news on readers' lives. The other is *Why*?

[]{#part0176.html_page814}Why did they abandon the merger? Why did they fire the boss? Readers, investors, and creditors all want these answers. And as business becomes more complex, more international, answers to these questions become increasingly important.

On this point, I should add that not all reporting of good news is necessarily welcome to businessmen. For example, when the Bell Telephone System became the first corporation in history to earn one billion dollars in a single quarter, we thought the achievement ought to be recognized, and displayed the story on the front page. But a New Jersey public-service commissioner saw it there, and rejected a rate increase on the ground that profits were too high. Bell System executives might well think it would be wiser in the future to hide their light under a bushel. So, I don't think "Why don't you play up the good news?" is a valid question. That's not our function. Our job is to give the reader accurate information he can use about what is important and what interests him. That is also an important goal of business.

Let's get to basics. Fifty years ago, an American president could say, with much justification, that "the business of America is business." We've gone beyond that. The business of America is freedom.

For the journalist, that means the freedom to get to the root of the truth, the freedom to criticize, the freedom to goad and stimulate every institution in our society, including our own.

For businessmen, that means the freedom to compete fairly, on the basis of value and service. And it means the freedom to defend themselves against unfair charges by pressure groups, to assert the principle of the profit motive, and to fight off excessive or stultifying government regulation.

For the consumer of your product and mine, it means the freedom to hold our claims to account, the freedom to complain like hell and get attention paid to those complaints, and the freedom to choose a competitor if we fail them.

Let me, then, practice what I preach about the new coverage of business news. Here are a few ideas we can use in our business lives.

First, *get out front*. Teamwork may be great, and the organization spirit is commendable, but business news is made by people. Individuals. Human beings. Business leadership ought to include some public leadership---but the trouble is, the public perception of business leaders is all too often that of the *bland* leading the *bland*. Oh, there are some exceptions, and Detroit is home to some of them. Yet, in a recent poll, 93 percent of the people interviewed could identify Walter Cronkite; 79 percent, Henry Kissinger; 66 percent, George Meany; but when they []{#part0176.html_page815}were asked about Thomas Murphy and John de Butts, they wondered if the pollsters were putting them on. Less than 3 percent could identify the heads of General Motors and AT&T.

Why are there so few business heroes? Is the press trying to hide the identity of businessmen, or are businessmen worried about becoming celebrities? It is true that with public renown comes vulnerability, both personal and corporate; many businessmen choose, out of modesty or caution, to stay out of the limelight. A faceless official spokesman often becomes the voice of the company.

Even publishers should show their faces now and then. I think it's a fine thing when somebody comes up to me after a speech and says, "You're doing a great job with your newspaper, Mr. Chandler."

Next, *stop talking the inside lingo of business*. Whenever businessmen get together, they bemoan the fact that business is "failing to communicate," whatever that means. One reason may be that they're talking a specialized language that the public is not about to take the time to learn.

That language barrier concerns us at the *Times*. Occasionally, we hear the charge that newspaper and television reporters are poorly prepared to talk to business people about financial subjects. And it is true that the subject matter is becoming more complex, involving nuclear safety, or tanker technology, changes in accounting rules, and the like. From our side, we're hiring more reporters with formal educations in business subjects---*not* so much to talk the language of businessmen, but to interpret these complex subjects for the lay reader.

Third, *go looking for complaints*. That sounds strange, I know---most of us have all the complaints we can handle. But I was reading a *U.S. News and World Report* survey of some five thousand heads of households. The biggest problem business had was credibility: most people say they do not believe what business claims about its products. That's troublesome, but the same survey turned up this hopeful note: of the one-fourth of the people who had made a complaint to a manufacturer about a product in the past year, nearly half of them said they were satisfied in the way those complaints were handled.

Think about that: one of the biggest pluses American business has going for it is the satisfaction of the customer who complains, and whose complaints are heard. And it's better that *they* complain to the businessman than to write to their congressman.

We deal with gripes in the newspaper business all the time. One of the best-read sections of every paper is the "Letters to the Editor," and the best letters are the ones that slam us all over the page. The *Times* also has a "corrections" corner, originally because we thought that was the []{#part0176.html_page816}responsible thing to do, but now it is turning into a well-read feature. Why? Because nobody's perfect---customers and readers understand that, and react well to efforts to improve.

And, finally, *do some complaining yourself*. Fight for your rights---everyone else is, and business has just as much a right to be heard as any other force in our society.

Just about every survey about public perceptions of business shows that the strongest antibusiness feeling is on the college campus. That's a big challenge, and it invites a kind of sensitive confrontation. Businessmen, especially young businessmen, should assume that burden; it cannot be solved only by taking an ad in the college newspaper. To combat antibusiness feeling at its source, businessmen have to arrange to tie into college activities, participate in seminars, and have honest answers to student questions about environmental and human concerns. Nor is there any need to be on the defensive; we know that the market system outperforms any other, and it includes the irreplaceable element of personal freedom. That's not something to apologize for; that's something to proudly assert.

I think you'll find more places in which to make that kind of affirmation. Many newspapers are adopting op-ed pages, seeking expressions of outside opinion.

On the *Times*, one of our most popular Sunday features is a page of outside opinion labeled "Point of View," where businessmen and academics and government officials blaze away on everything from energy policy to capital shortages.

More than ever, across the spectrum of our lives, that element of controversy is a vital part of the news. News is not only what happens but what people think has happened, and what values they attach to what *has*, or *has not*, taken place. Business is a prime part of that creative controversy; so is journalism. Sometimes it hurts; most of the time it's fairly exciting and quite constructive.

My point is this: it is not so much a matter of the *press* being antibusiness, which I have to admit it *sometimes* is. Nor is it a matter of *business* being antipress, which you will have to admit it *usually* is. That tension between press and business---in a relationship not quite so adversary as that which exists between press and government---is the healthy tension in a land of separated and balancing centers of power.

Is the press antibusiness? The answer is no. Is the press antidullness, antistuffiness, anticorporate secrecy? The answer is yes.

Is a probing, skeptical, searching press coverage good for business? I think so. You may not agree completely. You might look at modern business []{#part0176.html_page817}news coverage the way John Wanamaker looked at advertising: half of it is wasted, he felt, but he never knew which half.

Business and journalism share certain great values: we are both pro-opportunity; we are both proconsumer; we are both proprofit; and we are both profreedom.

We are looking at each other now with new eyes, in a kind of institutional midlife crisis. And I think we're both going to come through it stronger than ever.
