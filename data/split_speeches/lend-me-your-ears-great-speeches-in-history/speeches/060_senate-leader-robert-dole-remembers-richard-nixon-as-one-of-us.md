# Senate Leader Robert Dole Remembers Richard Nixon as "One of Us" {#part0068.html_c60 .toc}

*"I believe the second half of the twentieth century will be known as the Age of Nixon."*
:::

Badly wounded as an Army Lieutenant in World War II, Bob Dole rose from years in a hospital bed to become a Kansas congressman, Republican national chairman, Senate majority leader, and three-time candidate for national office.

Over the years, his speaking style changed: Dole was known in the sixties for a mordant wit, which sometimes backfired: at the start of the Nixon campaign of 1972, he referred to the Committee to Reelect the President by its acronym CREEP, an innocuous crack that gained a sinister second meaning after the stealthy Watergate break-in. In a 1976 debate with Walter Mondale, Dole as Republican vice-presidential nominee struck viewers as an embittered man with his denunciation of "Democrat wars," and in the aftermath of a primary loss in New Hampshire to George Bush in 1988, the defeated candidate lashed back []{#part0068.html_page252}with an admonition to Bush to "stop lying about my record." That became known as "the old Dole."

In the nineties, he blunted the edge of bitterness and usually adopted a more relaxed, somewhat less partisan demeanor. When the Republicans took control of Congress in 1994, the pragmatic Dole presented a contrast to the fiery Speaker Newt Gingrich. His speaking style as well as the substance of his speeches was more attuned to the Senate than the stump: policy-laden, detailed, argumentative with overtones of reasonableness, passion-free, sometimes persuasive, but not especially memorable. His best speeches, including his 1996 farewell to the Senate, lay ahead.

His acceptance address at the 1996 Republican convention in San Diego, drafted by the novelist Mark Helprin, began with a reference to "plain speaking"---in contrast to the soaring rhetoric of his opponent, President Clinton---but contained such felicitous phrases as "the gracious compensations of age" and "Let me be the bridge to a time of tranquillity, faith, and confidence in action." That bridge metaphor was taken up by Mr. Clinton and turned against Dole, as the President contrasted the seventy-three-year-old challenger's "bridge to the past" with his own "bridge to the twenty-first century." Almost as if in anticipation of that counterattack, Dole wrote the headline to his own coverage by pronouncing himself at the end "the most optimistic man in America."

His speaking style on the stump, however, was staccato, repeating words and phrases for emphasis, and sometimes lamely ending a series of points with "whatever." Skillful in talk-show appearances, his campaign oratory came across as strident and unfocused; on occasion, however, he would attack ethical lapses with a theme that reverberated later, as in "Where's the outrage?"

At moments of high drama throughout his career, the seemingly stoic Dole allowed his emotion to show through. His eulogy at the funeral of Richard Nixon on April 27, 1994, brought to the surface a deep emotion at the loss of a friend and mentor. The setting was the Nixon Library and birthplace in Yorba Linda, California; four thousand diehard Nixon supporters and family members were in attendance, along with all of America's living presidents and first ladies. (President Gerald Ford began his eulogy with "Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President...")

Dole began with, and in the end reprised, the theme of Nixon as "one of us" (the title of liberal columnist Tom Wicker's surprisingly admiring biography of Nixon). The end of each of four sentences naming some example of his us-ness was punctuated effectively with "How American." In defining Nixon's "silent majority," Dole described his own political lodestar: "Like them, he valued accomplishment more than ideology."

[]{#part0068.html_page253}Delivering a eulogy to a loved one or a close friend is the greatest strain in oratory, as anyone who has done it knows. Halfway through the final paragraph, Dole began to break down and sobbed his way through the last sentence. Appearing on television with the anthologist a half-hour later, Dole---known more for sarcasm than for sentiment---was slightly, not greatly, embarrassed by the loss of control at the end that had underscored his sincerity: "Just couldn't make it through. Almost did."

**[I BELIEVE THE]{.small}** second half of the twentieth century will be known as the Age of Nixon. Why was he the most durable public figure of our time? Not because he gave the most eloquent speeches, but because he provided the most effective leadership. Not because he won every battle, but because he always embodied the deepest feelings of the people he led.

One of his biographers said that Richard Nixon was one of us, and so he was. He was a boy who heard the train whistle in the night and dreamed of all the distant places that lay at the end of the track. How American.

He was the grocer's son who got ahead by working harder and longer than everyone else. How American.

He was a student who met expenses by doing research at the law library for thirty-five cents an hour while sharing a rundown farmhouse without water or electricity. How American.

He was the husband and father who said that the best memorial to his wife was her children. How American.

To tens of millions of his countrymen, Richard Nixon was an American hero. A hero who shared and honored their belief in working hard, worshiping God, loving their families, and saluting the flag. He called them the silent majority. Like them, he valued accomplishment more than ideology. They wanted their government to do the decent thing, but not to bankrupt them in the process. They wanted his protection in a dangerous world, but they also wanted creative statesmanship in achieving a genuine peace with honor. These were the people from whom he had come and who have come to Yorba Linda these past few days by the tens of thousands, no longer silent in their grief.

The American people love a fighter, and in Dick Nixon they found a gallant one. In her marvelous biography of her mother, Julie recalls an occasion where Pat Nixon expressed amazement at her husband's ability to persevere in the face of criticism, to which the president replied, "I just get up every morning to confound my enemies." It was what Richard []{#part0068.html_page254}Nixon did after he got up every morning that not just confounded his enemies but turned them into admirers.

It is true that no one knew the world better than Richard Nixon, and as a result, the man who was born in a house his father built would go on to become this century's greatest architect of peace.

But we should also not underestimate President Nixon's domestic achievements, for it was Richard Nixon who ended the draft, strengthened environmental and nutritional programs, and committed the government to a war on cancer. He leap-frogged the conventional wisdom to propose revolutionary solutions to health care and welfare reform, anticipating by a full generation the debates now raging on Capitol Hill.

I remember the last time I saw him, at a luncheon held at the Capitol honoring the twenty-fifth anniversary of his first inaugural. Without a note, President Nixon stood and delivered a compelling speech, capturing the global scene as only he could, and sharing his vision of America's future. When it was over, he was surrounded by Democrats and Republicans alike, each wanting just one more word of Nixonian counsel, one more insight into world affairs.

Afterward the president rested in my office before leaving the Capitol, only he got very little rest. For the office was filled with young Hill staffers, members of the Capitol police, and many, many others, all hoping to shake his hand, get an autograph, or simply convey their special feelings for a man who was truly one of us.

Today our grief is shared by millions of people the world over, but it is also mingled with intense pride in a great patriot who never gave up and who never gave in. To know the secret of Richard Nixon's relationship with the American people, you need only to listen to his words: "You must never be satisfied with success," he told us, "and you should never be discouraged by failure. Failure can be sad, but the greatest sadness is not to try and fail, but to fail to try. In the end what matters is that you have always lived life to the hilt."

Strong, brave, unafraid of controversy, unyielding in his convictions, living every day of his life to the hilt, the largest figure of our time whose influence will be timeless. That was Richard Nixon. How American. May God bless Richard Nixon and may God bless the United States.
