*"We are all one, side by side, and we shouldn't spit on each other."*
:::

After six years of *perestroika*, with the Soviet Union's economy crumbling and its constituent republics demanding more power, a group of Communist hard-liners and KGB generals staged a coup to return to autocratic central rule. The military forces would not fire on the people, however; the coup failed, its leaders were arrested, and a chastened and subdued Mikhail Gorbachev returned to Moscow to negotiate a loose confederation of republics.

On September 3, 1991, during a session of the Congress of People's Deputies, the leader who had been criticized for taking half-measures and for trusting villainous aides---who had, after all, set in train the events he could not control---made a brief defense of himself before calling for a new constitutional framework. A feisty and charismatic presence at the rostrum, enjoying the sound of his own extemporaneous words, Mr. Gorbachev has rarely made a memorable speech, because he does not take the time to prepare a coherent address. When he does read a speech on a formal occasion, as at the UN, his presentation turns as leaden as his bureaucratic prose. In this passage spoken at a critical moment in his nation's history, he refers to himself in the third person, which is a good technique in critical self-appraisal. His use of the stark verb "spit" at the end to admonish those who had shown their contempt for him, is especially vivid.

**[DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF]{.small}** the Congress, in the past week the people have decided on their fate, not only in the parliaments, not only in public conflicts and clashes of views and in the meetings, but also on the barricades.

We have seen a tragedy. We've seen bloodletting.

My evaluation of this is known to all of you. I had in mind to present []{#part0217.html_page1057}them to you in fuller form if I was going to speak as a person presenting a report. But here I will limit myself to saying that everything that has occurred has been a very hard lesson for me to learn.

But at the same time it confirms that despite the high drama of these events, as a result of this coup d'état against the constitution, despite the fact that it made everything in our country even more tense than it was on the day before the signature of the new union treaty on a union of sovereign states, which is designed to strengthen our cooperation, and despite the fact that we have lost time for solving economic problems and despite the fact that the social situation in the country is on the verge of catastrophe---despite all of this, I say that this coup d' état did confirm that what we have been doing since 1985 made it possible to create new realities and a new basis for our country so that from the very beginning, and this was stated on the eighteenth when this mission came to the Crimea, that it was condemned to failure.

The people did not accept it. The army stayed side by side with the people. For the first time, we saw a new generation that has come into existence in these last several years and that was willing to give up its lives for these new realities.

We've seen that we did not work in vain, you and I in our new thinking, in forming new relations between the government and the people who, at that difficult moment, decided with the democrats and against the putschists. We thus have accomplished something.

And of course we made many mistakes at the same time in this connection, as concerns our direction and these revolutionary transformations which we are undertaking, and this includes Gorbachev, too.

Gorbachev has changed to the extent that he has remained devoted to the choice he made in 1985. If there have been mistakes, if there have been miscalculations in tactics and in measures---but he also did not notice that it was necessary to move more rapidly along the path of liberating ourselves from those totalitarian structures.

What is more, he was not able---I know that not only at public meetings but even in the Congress, people say anything they want about the president, but while I am president, I think there should be some understanding of my position.

Today you have a president. Tomorrow you may have another president. In any case, we are all one, side by side, and we shouldn't spit on each other. This is just my reaction to all of these doubts that have been cast on my conduct.
