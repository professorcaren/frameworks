*"I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility... without the help and support of the woman I love."*
:::

For King Edward VIII to marry Wallis Simpson, a divorcée, he was required by the religious and political establishment to abdicate the British throne. On December 11, 1936, the former king, now the duke of Windsor, spoke to an international audience from Windsor Castle in the radio broadcast of his farewell address.

Although Winston Churchill is often credited with writing the farewell, the duke of Windsor denied such reports and said that Churchill added only a few phrases to the speech that he himself wrote. This is probably true, although his friend and aide Walter Monckton surely had a hand in the drafting. Lord Beaverbrook called it "a triumph of natural and sincere eloquence," but Lady Ravensdale considered it "hot-making and melodramatic." The abdicating king's mother, Queen Mary, wrote bitterly of "the failure of my Son in not carrying on the duties and responsibilities of the Sovereign of our great Empire," and many commoners in Britain felt he had "let down the side" by putting love before duty; Albert Julius, a jeweler in Piccadilly, a generation later traced the decline of British moral and political power to that day. But Churchill, in bidding farewell to the ex-monarch after the speech, quoted poet Andrew Marvell's ode on the beheading of Charles I: "He nothing common did or mean / Upon that memorable scene."

Succeeded by his brother, George VI, the duke of Windsor was introduced on the broadcast by his brother's instructions as "His Royal Highness Prince Edward." Legend has it that Edward VIII's reference to "radio" rather than "wireless" was responsible for making the older term obsolete, but the address itself contains neither word. In America, radio listeners in the early-morning hours were moved by the brave-sounding words over the crackling signal; the anthologist, then six, learned of the impact a speech could have as he listened with his mother, who cried at the royal reference to "the woman I love."

[]{#part0100.html_page422}**[AT LONG LAST]{.small}** I am able to say a few words of my own. I have never wanted to withhold anything, but until now it has not been constitutionally possible for me to speak.

A few hours ago I discharged my last duty as king and emperor, and now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the duke of York, my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him. This I do with all my heart.

You all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne. But I want you to understand that in making up my mind I did not forget the country or the empire, which, as prince of Wales and lately as king, I have for twenty-five years tried to serve.

But you must believe me when I tell you that I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love.

And I want you to know that the decision I have made has been mine and mine alone. This was a thing I had to judge entirely for myself. The other person most nearly concerned has tried up to the last to persuade me to take a different course.

I have made this, the most serious decision of my life, only upon the single thought of what would, in the end, be best for all.

This decision has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother, with his long training in the public affairs of this country and with his fine qualities, will be able to take my place forthwith without interruption or injury to the life and progress of the empire. And he has one matchless blessing, enjoyed by so many of you, and not bestowed on me---a happy home with his wife and children.

During these hard days I have been comforted by Her Majesty my mother and by my family. The ministers of the crown and, in particular, Mr. Baldwin, the prime minister, have always treated me with full consideration. There has never been any constitutional difference between me and them, and between me and Parliament. Bred in the constitutional tradition by my father, I should never have allowed any such issue to arise.

Ever since I was prince of Wales, and later on when I occupied the throne, I have been treated with the greatest kindness by all classes of the people wherever I have lived or journeyed throughout the empire. For that I am very grateful.

I now quit altogether public affairs, and I lay down my burden. It may []{#part0100.html_page423}be some time before I return to my native land, but I shall always follow the fortunes of the British race and empire with profound interest, and if at any time in the future I can be found of service to His Majesty in a private station, I shall not fail.

And now, we all have a new king. I wish him and you, his people, happiness and prosperity with all my heart. God bless you all! God save the king!
