*"Then let my motto be 'The man and woman who shall live correctly and bring forth children, they are my people.'"*
:::

When the previous king died without an heir to the throne of Hawaii, David Kalakaua, over the strong objection of a more popular candidate, Dowager Queen Emma, was chosen to succeed him; American and British warships put down the subsequent rioting. On April 13, 1874, he spoke at the capital city of Lahaina, and "His Majesty's Address to the People of Lahaina" served to announce the policies of this new king.

The Hawaiian Islands had both prospered and suffered during the first half of the nineteenth century. A financial boom of European and American trade followed Captain James Cook's 1778 discovery of the islands, but along with the trade came infectious diseases and the replacement of much native tradition by Western culture.

The king's address sought to unify his people through the common purposes of increasing commerce and repopulating the islands. His allusions to Hawaiian history point back to 1810, when Kamehameha I became the sole ruler of the islands and brought peace to the area. Kalakaua's analogy of restoring a dilapidated house leads into specific statements of his intended policy, particularly the critical need for strengthening the family unit and increasing the native population of Hawaii.

**[PEOPLE OF LAHAINA]{.small}**, before addressing to you the brief remarks which I propose to make on this occasion, I cannot omit referring to some memories of my late lamented predecessor, who made a short visit here last year, on the journey which he undertook for the benefit of his health. The late king was deeply solicitous for the welfare of his people, but the condition of his health was such that he was unable to carry out his plans for their good. I regarded the late king and his two immediate predecessors with strong affection, for on these sands and among these []{#part0193.html_page914}fields of Lahaina, they and I have played together as boys, in the family of our grandmother, Hoapili Wahine. The recollections of those days long past come before me vividly now.

And now I have come hither to see you, as my children, and that you may look upon me as your father. I thank you very much, people of the district of Lahaina, for the very warm and loyal reception which you have given us, one which neither myself, the queen, nor the members of the royal family can cease to remember with pleasure.

The principal object which I have had in view in making this journey among my people, is that we may all be incited to renewed exertions for the advancement and prosperity of our nation, the extinction of which has been prophesied.

Figures of the census have been published to show that we are a dying race. But shall we sit still, and indolently see the structure created by our fathers fall to pieces without lifting a hand to stay the work of destruction? If the house is dilapidated, let us repair it. Let us thoroughly renovate our own selves, to the end that, causes of decay being removed, the nation may grow again with new life and vigor, and our government may be firmly established---that structure which our fathers erected.

There are some of the old folks remaining and here present, the people of the time of Kamehameha I, who heard that celebrated saying "The old men, the old women, and the children may sleep by the wayside without fear." That motto remains good to this day. Kamehameha II broke the taboo on social intercourse---his word was *O ka ainoa*. Said Kamehameha III, "The righteous man is my man," and this sentiment prevails today among us, both foreigners and natives. I believe that if I shall make the main object of my reign the increase of the nation, there may be secured both the stability of the government and the national independence. Then let my motto be "The man and woman who shall live correctly and bring forth children, they are my people." And I charge you parents, take every care of your little ones. And to you children also I say, obey your parents.

The increase of the people, the advancement of agriculture and commerce---these are the objects which my government will mainly strive to accomplish.
