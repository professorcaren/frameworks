*"The views of this fraternity do not represent the views of America."*
:::

When the Republican presidential nominee Richard M. Nixon chose Governor Spiro T. Agnew of Maryland, a moderate Republican, to be his running mate in 1968, he had in mind a steady politician who could deliver a fair speech and not cause too much controversy. That was not how it worked out.

During the campaign, "Spiro Who?" was laughed at by reporters for his gaffes ("You've seen one slum and you've seen 'em all") and reviled for ethnic insensitivity ("How's the 'Fat Jap'?"), causing him to counter with "I'm a Greek---excuse me, I'm Grecian." The vice-presidential nominee developed a burning dislike for most members of what he called "the elite press."

So did Patrick J. Buchanan, a young Nixon speechwriter who supervised the daily news summary and bridled at the barbs aimed at the administration. He was especially angered at the "instant analysis" after the president's November 3, 1969, "silent majority" speech, and drafted a speech for delivery by the vice-president at a Republican gathering in Des Moines, Iowa. When Mr. Nixon reviewed the draft, he made a couple of minor emendations and said to Buchanan, "This really flicks the scab off, doesn't it?"

It really did. The political target became the huntsman; Mr. Agnew read the speech---all the more biting because of its reasoned tone---with relish. Suddenly speechmaking became an event again; network news executives, to show fairness, felt constrained to cover Mr. Agnew's criticism of themselves, and the Buchanan-Agnew antimedia message---soon followed up with a blast at "an effete corps of impudent snobs" at our nation's most prestigious schools---struck a chord of resentment in much of the public.

The following year, Ted Agnew became the Nixon "point man" in the midterm political campaign, flaying "radic-libs" (a not too subtle play on "comsymps") across the country. Most 1970 Republican candidates welcomed []{#part0175.html_page806}the "red meat" in the Agnew speeches, which were written by Buchanan, Bryce Harlow, and me; one who did not was George Bush, running for the Senate in Texas as a moderate. He spurned the Agnew right-wing rhetoric and lost to Lloyd Bentsen.

I contributed the "nattering nabobs of negativism" alliteration to an Agnew speech in San Diego, a dig at pessimists that was inspired by Adlai Stevenson's "prophets of gloom and doom." But none of the carefully crafted, sociopolitical speeches of Agnew matched the impact of the Des Moines speech; for at least a generation, he killed "instant analysis."

In 1973, with the presidency all but in his grasp as the Watergate scandal began to unfold, Agnew pleaded no contest to corruption charges and copped a plea by resigning his vice-presidency. His disgrace as a pol on the take cast a cloud over his message for years, but some of the themes in his speeches (anti-drug culture, anti-elitism, resentment toward Washington establishments, all clothed in unabashed or strident patriotism) were later taken up by political speakers in both parties.

**[TONIGHT I WANT]{.small}** to discuss the importance of the television news medium to the American people. No nation depends more on the intelligent judgment of its citizens. No medium has a more profound influence over public opinion. Nowhere in our system are there fewer checks on vast power. So nowhere should there be more conscientious responsibility exercised than by the news media. The question is, Are we demanding enough of our television news presentations? And, are the men of this medium demanding enough of themselves?

Monday night, a week ago, President Nixon delivered the most important address of his administration, one of the most important of our decade. His subject was Vietnam. His hope was to rally the American people to see the conflict through to a lasting and just peace in the Pacific. For thirty-two minutes, he reasoned with a nation that has suffered almost a third of a million casualties in the longest war in its history.

When the president completed his address---an address that he spent weeks in preparing---his words and policies were subjected to instant analysis and querulous criticism. The audience of seventy million Americans---gathered to hear the president of the United States---was inherited by a small band of network commentators and self-appointed analysts, the *majority* of whom expressed, in one way or another, their hostility to what he had to say.

[]{#part0175.html_page807}It was obvious that their minds were made up in advance. Those who recall the fumbling and groping that followed President Johnson's dramatic disclosure of his intention not to seek reelection have seen these men in a genuine state of nonpreparedness. This was not it.

One commentator twice contradicted the president's statement about the exchange of correspondence with Ho Chi Minh. Another challenged the president's abilities as a politician. A third asserted that the president was now "following the Pentagon line." Others, by the expressions on their faces, the tone of their questions. and the sarcasm of their responses, made clear their sharp disapproval....

Every American has a right to disagree with the president of the United States, and to express publicly that disagreement.

But the president of the United States has a right to communicate directly with the people who elected him, and the people of this country have the right to make up their own minds and form their own opinions about a presidential address without having the president's words and thoughts characterized through the prejudices of hostile critics before they can even be digested. When Winston Churchill rallied public opinion to stay the course against Hitler's Germany, he did not have to contend with a gaggle of commentators raising doubts about whether he was reading public opinion right, or whether Britain had the stamina to see the war through. When President Kennedy rallied the nation in the Cuban missile crisis, his address to the people was not chewed over by a roundtable of critics who disparaged the course of action he had asked America to follow.

The purpose of my remarks tonight is to focus your attention on this little group of men who not only enjoy a right of instant rebuttal to every presidential address but, more importantly, wield a free hand in selecting, presenting, and interpreting the great issues of our nation.

First, let us define that power. At least forty million Americans each night, it is estimated, watch the network news. Seven million of them view ABC; the remainder being divided between NBC and CBS. According to Harris polls and other studies, for millions of Americans the networks are the sole source of national and world news.

In Will Rogers's observation, what you knew was what you read in the newspaper. Today, for growing millions of Americans, it is what they see and hear on their television sets.

How is this network news determined? A small group of men, numbering perhaps no more than a dozen "anchormen," commentators, and executive producers, settle upon the 20 minutes or so of film and commentary that is to reach the public. This selection is made from the 90 to []{#part0175.html_page808}180 minutes that may be available. Their powers of choice are broad. They decide what forty to fifty million Americans will learn of the day's events in the nation and the world.

We cannot measure this power and influence by traditional democratic standards, for these men can create national issues overnight. They can make or break---by their coverage and commentary---a moratorium on the war. They can elevate men from local obscurity to national prominence within a week. They can reward some politicians with national exposure and ignore others. For millions of Americans, the network reporter who covers a continuing issue, like ABM or civil rights, becomes, in effect, the presiding judge in a national trial by jury.

It must be recognized that the networks have made important contributions to the national knowledge. Through news, documentaries, and specials, they have often used their power constructively and creatively to awaken the public conscience to critical problems.

The networks made "hunger" and "black lung" disease national issues overnight. The TV networks have done what no other medium could have done in terms of dramatizing the horrors of war. The networks have tackled our most difficult social problems with a directness and immediacy that is the gift of their medium. They have focused the nation's attention on its environmental abuses, on pollution in the Great Lakes and the threatened ecology of the Everglades.

But it was also the networks that elevated Stokely Carmichael and George Lincoln Rockwell from obscurity to national prominence. Nor is their power confined to the substantive.

A raised eyebrow, an inflection of the voice, a caustic remark dropped in the middle of a broadcast can raise doubts in a million minds about the veracity of a public official or the wisdom of a government policy.

One federal communications commissioner considers the power of the networks to equal that of local, state, and federal governments combined. Certainly, it represents a concentration of power over American public opinion unknown in history.

What do Americans know of the men who wield this power? Of the men who produce and direct the network news, the nation knows practically nothing. Of the commentators, most Americans know little, other than that they reflect an urbane and assured presence, seemingly well informed on every important matter.

We do know that, to a man, these commentators and producers live and work in the geographical and intellectual confines of Washington, D.C., or New York City---the latter of which James Reston terms the "most unrepresentative community in the entire United States." Both []{#part0175.html_page809}communities bask in their own provincialism, their own parochialism. We can deduce that these men thus read the same newspapers, and draw their political and social views from the same sources. Worse, they talk constantly to one another, thereby providing artificial reinforcement to their shared viewpoints....

The views of this fraternity do *not* represent the views of America. That is why such a great gulf existed between how the nation received the president's address---and how the networks reviewed it.

As with other American institutions, perhaps it is time that the networks were made more responsive to the views of the nation and more responsible to the people they serve.

I am not asking for government censorship or any other kind of censorship. I am asking whether a form of censorship already exists when the news that forty million Americans receive each night is determined by a handful of men responsible only to their corporate employers and filtered through a handful of commentators who admit to their own set of biases.

The questions I am raising here tonight should have been raised by others long ago. They should have been raised by those Americans who have traditionally considered the preservation of freedom of speech and freedom of the press their special provinces of responsibility and concern. They should have been raised by those Americans who share the view of the late Justice Learned Hand that "right conclusions are more likely to be gathered out of a multitude of tongues than through any kind of authoritative selection."

Advocates for the networks have claimed a First Amendment right to the same unlimited freedoms held by the great newspapers of America.

The situations are not identical. Where the *New York Times* reaches 800,000 people, NBC reaches twenty times that number with its evening news. Nor can the tremendous impact of seeing television film and hearing commentary be compared with reading the printed page. And in the networks' endless pursuit of controversy, we should ask, What is the end value---to enlighten or to profit? What is the end result---to inform or to confuse? How does the ongoing exploration for more action, more excitement, more drama, serve our national search for internal peace and stability?

Gresham's law seems to be operating in the network news.

Bad news drives out good news. The irrational is more controversial than the rational. Concurrence can no longer compete with dissent. One minute of Eldridge Cleaver is worth ten minutes of Roy Wilkins. The labor crisis settled at the negotiating table is nothing compared to the []{#part0175.html_page810}confrontation that results in a strike---or, better yet, violence along the picket line. Normality has become the nemesis of the evening news.

The upshot of all this controversy is that a narrow and distorted picture of America often emerges from the televised news. A single dramatic piece of the mosaic becomes, in the minds of millions, the whole picture. The American who relies upon television for his news might conclude that the majority of American students are embittered radicals, that the majority of black Americans feel no regard for their country, that violence and lawlessness are the rule, rather than the exception, on the American campus. None of these conclusions is true.

Television may have destroyed the old stereotypes---but has it not created new ones in their place?

What has this passionate pursuit of "controversy" done to the politics of progress through logical compromise, essential to the functioning of a democratic society?

The members of Congress or the Senate who follow their principles and philosophy quietly in a spirit of compromise are unknown to many Americans---while the loudest and most extreme dissenters on every issue are known to every man in the street.

How many marches and demonstrations would we have if the marchers did not know that the ever-faithful TV cameras would be there to record their antics for the next news show.

We have heard demands that senators and congressmen and judges make known all their financial connections---so that the public will know who and what influences their decisions or votes. Strong arguments can be made for that view. But when a single commentator or producer, night after night, determines for millions of people how much of each side of a great issue they are going to see and hear, should he not first disclose his personal views on the issue as well?

In this search for excitement and controversy, has more than equal time gone to that minority of Americans who specialize in attacking the United States, its institutions, and its citizens?

Tonight, I have raised questions. I have made no attempt to suggest answers. These answers must come from the media men. They are challenged to turn their critical powers on themselves. They are challenged to direct their energy, talent, and conviction toward improving the quality and objectivity of news presentation. They are challenged to structure their own civic ethics to relate their great freedom with their great responsibility.

And the people of America are challenged too, challenged to press for responsible news presentations. The people can let the networks know []{#part0175.html_page811}that they want their news straight and objective. The people can register their complaints on bias through mail to the networks and phone calls to local stations. This is one case where the people must defend themselves, where the citizen---not government---must be the reformer, where the consumer can be the most effective crusader.

By way of conclusion, let me say that every elected leader in the United States depends on these men of the media. Whether what I have said to you tonight will be heard and seen at all by the nation is not *my* decision; it is not *your* decision; it is *their* decision.

In tomorrow's edition of the *Des Moines Register* you will be able to read a news story detailing what I said tonight; editorial comment will be reserved for the editorial page, where it belongs. Should not the same wall of separation exist between news and comment on the nation's networks.

We would never trust such power over public opinion in the hands of an elected government---it is time we questioned it in the hands of a small and unelected elite. The great networks have dominated America's airwaves for decades; the people are entitled to a full accounting of their stewardship.
