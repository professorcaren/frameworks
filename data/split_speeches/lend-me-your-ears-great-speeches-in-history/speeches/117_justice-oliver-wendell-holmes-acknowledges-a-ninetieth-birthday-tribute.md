*"To live is to function."*
:::

As a young union officer, Oliver Wendell Holmes told President Lincoln, visiting his battery, to get his head down before it was blown off. In 1902, Theodore Roosevelt appointed the Harvard law professor, then sixty, to the Supreme Court. Justice Holmes emerged from the shadow of his famous father, the Autocrat of the Breakfast Table, to become what biographers called the Yankee from Olympus. Though he wrote only 173 dissents in his thirty years on the Court, their quality earned him the sobriquet the Great Dissenter---a judge whose disagreements with the majority presaged a judicial movement toward free expression and a more liberal reading of the Constitution.

On March 7, 1931, on the occasion of the celebration of his ninetieth []{#part0130.html_page548}birthday, Justice Holmes concluded a radio tribute with this response. The "little finishing canter" is a vivid metaphor; he lived four more years.

**[IN THIS SYMPOSIUM]{.small}** my part is only to sit in silence. To express one's feelings as the end draws near is too intimate a task.

But I may mention one thought that comes to me as a listener in. The riders in a race do not stop short when they reach the goal. There is a little finishing canter before coming to a standstill. There is time to hear the kind voices of friends and to say to oneself, "The work is done." But just as one says that, the answer comes: "The race is over, but the work never is done while the power to work remains. The canter that brings you to a standstill need not be only coming to rest. It cannot be, while you still live. For to live is to function. That is all there is to living."

And so I end with a line from a Latin poet who uttered the message more than fifteen hundred years ago, "Death plucks my ear and says, Live---I am coming."
