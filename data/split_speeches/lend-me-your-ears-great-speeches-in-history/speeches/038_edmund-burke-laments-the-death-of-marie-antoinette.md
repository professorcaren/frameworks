*"The age of chivalry is gone...."*
:::

Pictured as spoiled and frivolous, Marie Antoinette never said the most famous words attributed to her. When told that the French people had no bread to eat, she supposedly replied, "Let them eat cake" ("Qu'ils mangent de la brioche"). Rousseau, however, had already recorded that "thoughtless saying of a great princess" in his *Confessions*, in 1767, years before Marie Antoinette's arrival in France.

Dissatisfaction of the common people and a sense of royal indifference to their plight fomented the French Revolution. King Louis XVI was executed for treason in early 1793, and his queen, Marie Antoinette, was sent to the guillotine later that same year.

Edmund Burke, the great English orator and conservative parliamentarian, had vigorously opposed the French Revolution as an unnecessary evil. Burke mourned the loss of Marie Antoinette and delivered a glowing tribute to her, remembering his vision of her twenty years before her execution. This drew the accusation of "foppery" from a friend who favored the Revolution, and Burke adamantly defended his words:

"Am I obliged to prove judicially the virtues of those I see suffering every kind of wrong?... I tell you again that the recollection of the manner in which I saw the queen of France in 1774 and the contrast between that brilliancy, splendor, and beauty, with the prostrate homage of a nation to her, and the abominable scene of 1789, which I was describing, did draw tears from me and wetted the paper. Those tears came again into my eyes almost as often as I looked at the description. They may again. You do not believe this fact nor that these are my real feelings, but that the whole is affected or, as you express it, 'downright foppery.' My friend, I tell you it is truth and that it is true and will be true when you and I are no more, and will exist as long as men with their natural feelings shall exist."

Was that last line in the mind of the *New York Evening Sun* editorialist []{#part0046.html_page184}who wrote the Santa-Claus-lives editorial to "Dear Virginia"? Probably not; it is one of those long thoughts expressed in a widely used but memorable construction.

**[IT IS NOW]{.small}** sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the queen of France, then the dauphiness, at Versailles; and surely never lighted on this orb, which she hardly seemed to touch, a more delightful vision. I saw her just above the horizon, decorating and cheering the elevated sphere she had just begun to move in, glittering like the morning star full of life and splendor and joy. O, what a revolution! and what a heart must I have, to contemplate without emotion that elevation and that fall! Little did I dream, when she added titles of veneration to those of enthusiastic, distant, respectful love, that she should ever be obliged to carry the sharp antidote against disgrace concealed in that bosom; little did I dream that I should have lived to see such disasters fallen upon her, in a nation of gallant men, in a nation of men of honor, and of cavaliers! I thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards, to avenge even a look that threatened her with insult.

But the age of chivalry is gone; that of sophisters, economists, and calculators has succeeded, and the glory of Europe is extinguished forever. Never, never more, shall we behold that generous loyalty to rank and sex, that proud submission, that dignified obedience, that subordination of the heart, which kept alive, even in servitude itself, the spirit of an exalted freedom! The unbought grace of life, the cheap defense of nations, the nurse of manly sentiment and heroic enterprise is gone. It is gone, that sensibility of principle, that chastity of honor, which felt a stain like a wound, which inspired courage whilst it mitigated ferocity, which ennobled whatever it touched, and under which vice itself lost half its evil, by losing all its grossness.
