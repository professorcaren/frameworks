*"First in war---first in peace---and first in the hearts of his countrymen...."*
:::

The death of George Washington in 1799 elicited a memorable tribute from Henry Lee. Lee, the father of Confederate military leader Robert E. Lee, was himself a Virginia officer whose revolutionary-war exploits and quick movements lent him the nickname Light-Horse Harry.

Henry Lee's funeral oration for Washington includes lists of reverential modifiers ("pious, just, humane") and archaic language ("Methinks I see his august image"). The dramatic device of attributing a speech to the deceased will appear again in Daniel Webster's eulogy for John Adams. Lee's tribute is remembered, however, almost exclusively for the elegant opening line ("First in war---first in peace---and first in the hearts of his countrymen") that has a horse's-hoofbeats rhythm and encapsulates in three short phrases the record and reputation of the first president of the United States.

\*\*\*

**[FIRST IN WAR]{.small}**---first in peace---and first in the hearts of his countrymen, he was second to none in the humble and endearing scenes of private life; pious, just, humane, temperate, and sincere; uniform, dignified, and commanding, his example was as edifying to all around him as were the effects of that example lasting.

To his equals he was condescending, to his inferiors kind, and to the dear object of his affections exemplarily tender; correct throughout, vice shuddered in his presence, and virtue always felt his fostering hand; the purity of his private character gave effulgence to his public virtues.

His last scene comported with the whole tenor of his life---although in extreme pain, not a sigh, not a groan escaped him; and with undisturbed serenity he closed his well-spent life. Such was the man America has lost---such was the man for whom our nation mourns.

Methinks I see his august image, and I hear falling from his venerable lips these deep-sinking words:

[]{#part0047.html_page186}"Cease, sons of America, lamenting our separation; go on, and confirm by your wisdom the fruits of our joint councils, joint efforts, and common dangers; reverence religion, diffuse knowledge throughout your land, patronize the arts and sciences; let liberty and order be inseparable companions. Control party spirit, the bane of free governments; observe good faith to, and cultivate peace with, all nations, shut up every avenue to foreign influence, contract rather than extend national connection, rely on ourselves only: be Americans in thought, word, and deed---thus will you give immortality to that union which was the constant object of my terrestrial labors; thus will you preserve undisturbed to the latest posterity the felicity of a people to me most dear, and thus will you supply (if my happiness is now aught to you) the only vacancy in the round of pure bliss high heaven bestows."
