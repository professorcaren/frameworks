*"If it doesn't fit, you must acquit."*
:::

An estimated 95 million television viewers watched the slow police chase of a Bronco vehicle that led to the arrest of a famous former football player and television personality. The 1995 criminal trial of Orenthal James Simpson for the murders of his wife, Nicole, and Ronald Goldman lasted 133 days, transfixing much of the nation and---through saturation coverage of the courtroom drama on live television---became a world event, often decried as a "media circus."

One of the trial's many dramatic moments came when the prosecution, led by Marcia Clark, demanded that the defendant try on the gloves worn by the killer. When O. J. Simpson had to struggle to get his fingers into them, that showed them to be too tight, and he delightedly exclaimed that they did not fit. (The prosecution lamely suggested that the gloves had shrunk after being bloodstained.) His lead attorney, Johnnie Cochran, then used a rhyming imperative repeatedly in his summation to the jury, equating the glove with all other anomalies in the prosecution's case, charging a scandalous frame-up by publicity-driven police: "If it doesn't fit, you must acquit." He characterized the seemingly damning evidence alliteratively as "contaminated, compromised, and ultimately corrupted." In his summation, Cochran repeated this theme, putting on a knit cap that was supposedly planned for use by his client: "It's no disguise. It makes no sense. It doesn't fit. If it doesn't fit, you must acquit."

The trial divided the nation along racial lines. Because Simpson, Cochran, and much of the jury were African-Americans, Cochran seemed to assume the role of a black preacher, especially in his rhyme and biblical citations. In a powerful summation, he began by quoting Frederick Douglass, the former slave who became a social reformer and the first black American political hero, on equal rights, which he said was of special interest "with a jury such as this." He recalled that one of the detectives testifying for the prosecution, Mark Fuhrman, lied when he []{#part0092.html_page386}claimed never to have used the word "nigger," thereby imputing the motive of racism to a key prosecution witness. Cochran drove that point home by returning to Douglass near the end, "for there are still the Mark Fuhrmans in this world, in this country, who hate and are yet embraced by people in power.... But you and I... must continue to fight to expose hate and genocidal racism...."

He posed a list of fifteen questions for the prosecution to answer. Prosecutor Clark took up the challenge and answered them forcefully in her final summation that followed, evidently not to the jury's satisfaction. When the verdict of "not guilty" came in on October 3, 1995, after only four hours of deliberation, television pictures showed groups of black viewers elated and cheering while white viewers were stunned and silent, dramatizing the polarization of attitudes this case caused in the nation. Afterward, Cochran co-counsel Robert Shapiro condemned the Cochran summation for "not only playing the race card, but playing it from the bottom of the deck."

True or not, the skilled lawyer's argument (and this excerpt includes only his summary of the details he presented to jurors) certainly helped establish the "reasonable doubt" that calls for acquittal. Two years after being freed, Simpson was tried on civil charges of having been responsible for wrongful death, where the standard of proof is lower and incarceration not a penalty. Simpson lost that case and was heavily fined.

**[AT THE OUTSET]{.small}**, let me join with the others in thanking you for the service that you've rendered. You are truly a marvelous jury, the longest serving jury in Los Angeles County, perhaps the most patient and healthy jury we've ever seen. I hope that your health and your good health continues....

You are empowered to do justice. You are empowered to ensure that this great system of ours works.

Listen for a moment, will you, please. One of my favorite people in history is the great Frederick Douglass. He said shortly after the slaves were freed, quote, "In a composite nation like ours as before the law, there should be no rich, no poor, no high, no low, no white, no black, but common country, common citizenship, equal rights and a common destiny."

This marvelous statement was made more than a hundred years ago. It's an ideal worth striving for and one that we still strive for. We haven't reached this goal yet, but certainly in this great country of ours, we're []{#part0092.html_page387}trying. With a jury such as this, we hope we can do that in this particular case....

A good efficient, competent, noncorrupt police department will carefully set about the business of investigating homicides. They won't rush to judgment. They won't be bound by an obsession to win at all costs. They will set about trying to apprehend the killer or killers and trying to protect the innocent from suspicion.

In this case, the victims' families had an absolute right to demand exactly just that in this case. But it was clear, unfortunately, that in this case there was another agenda. From the very first orders issued by the LAPD so-called brass, they were more concerned with their own images, the publicity that might be generated from this case, than they were in doing professional police work. That's why this case has become such a hallmark, and that's why Mr. Simpson is the one on trial.

But your verdict in this case will go far beyond the walls of Department 103, because your verdict talks about justice in America and it talks about the police and whether they're above the law and it looks at the police perhaps as though they haven't been looked at very recently. Remember, I told you this is not for the naïve, the faint of heart, or the timid.

So it seems to us that the evidence shows that professional police work took a backseat right at the beginning. Untrained officers trampled---remember, I used the word in opening statement---they traipsed through the evidence....

I was thinking last night about this case and their theory and how it didn't make sense and how it didn't fit and how something is wrong. It occurred to me how they were going to come here, stand up here and tell you how O. J. Simpson was going to disguise himself. He was going to put on a knit cap and some dark clothes, and he was going to get in his white Bronco, this recognizable person, and go over and kill his wife. That's what they want you to believe. That's how silly their argument is.

And I said to myself, maybe I can demonstrate this graphically. Let me show you something. This is a knit cap. Let me put this knit cap on. \[Puts on cap.\] You have seen me for a year. If I put this knit cap on, who am I? Still I'm Johnnie Cochran with a knit cap. And if you looked at O. J. Simpson over there---and he has a rather large head---O. J. Simpson in a knit cap from two blocks away is still O. J. Simpson. It's no disguise. It's no disguise. It makes no sense. It doesn't fit. If it doesn't fit, you must acquit....

I hope that during this phase of my argument I have demonstrated to you that this really is a case about a rush to judgment, an obsession to []{#part0092.html_page388}win, at all costs, a willingness to distort, twist, theorize in any fashion to try to get you to vote guilty in this case where it is not warranted. These metaphors about an ocean of evidence or a mountain of evidence are little more than a tiny, tiny stream, if at all, that points equally toward innocence, that any mountain has long ago been reduced to little more than a molehill under an avalanche of lies and complexity and conspiracy.

This is what we've shown you. And so as great as America is, we have not yet reached the point where there is equality in rights or equality of opportunity.

I started off talking to you a little bit about Frederick Douglass and what he said more than a hundred years ago, for there are still the Mark Fuhrmans in this world, in this country, who hate and are yet embraced by people in power. But you and I, fighting for freedom and ideals and for justice for all, must continue to fight to expose hate and genocidal racism and these tendencies. We then become the guardians of the Constitution....

This case is a tragedy for everybody, for certainly the victims and their families, for the Simpson family---and they are victims, too, because they lost the ex-daughter-in-law---for the defendant. He has been in custody since June of 1994 for a crime that he didn't commit. Someone has taken these children's mother. I certainly hope that your decision doesn't take their father....

I may never have an opportunity again to speak to you, certainly not in this setting.... In times like these we often turn to the Bible for some answers.... I happen to really like the book of Proverbs and in Proverbs it talks a lot about false witnesses. It says that a false witness shall not be unpunished and he that speaketh lies shall not escape.

That meant a lot to me in this case because there was Mark Fuhrman acting like a choirboy, making you believe he was the best witness that walked in here, generally applauded for his wonderful performance. It turns out he was the biggest liar in this courtroom during this process, for the Bible had already told us the answer, that a false witness shall not be unpunished and he that speaketh lies shall not escape. In that same book it tells us that a faithful witness will not lie but a false witness will utter lies. Finally, in Proverbs it says that he that speaketh the truth showeth the forthrightfulness but a false witness shows deceit.

So when we are talking about truth, we are talking about truth and lies and conspiracies and cover-ups. I always think about one of my favorite poems, which I think is so very appropriate for this case. You know when things are at the darkest there is always light the next day. In your life, in all of our lives, you have the capacity to transform Mr. O. J. []{#part0092.html_page389}Simpson's dark yesterday into bright tomorrow. You have that capacity. You have that power in your hands. And James Russell Lowell said it best about wrong and evil. He said that truth forever on the scaffold, wrong forever on the throne, yet that scaffold sways the future and beyond the dim unknown standeth God within the shadows, keeping watch above his own.

You walk with that every day, you carry that with you and things will come to you and you will be able to reveal people who come to you in uniforms and high positions who lie and are corrupt. That is what happened in this case and so the truth is now out. It is now up to you. We are going to pass this baton to you soon.

You will do the right thing. You have made a commitment for justice. You will do the right thing. I will someday go on to other cases, no doubt as will Miss Clark and Mr. Darden. Judge Ito will try another case someday, I hope, but this is O. J. Simpson's one day in court.

By your decision you control his very life in your hands. Treat it carefully. Treat it fairly. Be fair. Don't be part of this continuing cover-up. Do the right thing, remembering that "If it doesn't fit, you must acquit." That if these messengers have lied to you, you can't trust their message. That this has been a search for truth. That no matter how bad it looks, if truth is out there on a scaffold and wrong is in here on the throne, when that scaffold sways, in the future and beyond the dim unknown standeth the same God for all people keeping watch above his own.

He watches all of us and he will watch you in your decision. Thank you for your attention. God bless you.
