*"And with what are these on fire? With the fire of passion, say I, with the fire of hatred, with the fire of infatuation..."*

The Buddha is a title---The Enlightened One, or The Awakened One---given a prince named Siddhartha Gautama, born about the year 563 [B.C.]{.small} in a kingdom on the border of what today is Nepal and India. At twenty-nine he became an ascetic, then searched for a "middle way" between the hedonist's self-indulgence and the ascetic's self-mortification. Seated cross-legged under a banyan tree, he achieved what Buddhists call the great Enlightenment: the central truths are that mankind's life is filled with suffering; it is caused by craving; and there is freedom from such craving that is called the state of Nirvana, a cool and liberating detachment.

To a gathering of one thousand ascetics in the region of Uruvela, the Buddha delivered a *sutra*, or discourse, known as the "Fire Sermon." It is one of the basic scriptures of one of the world's great religions, driven by a drumbeat of repetition of key words and the evocation of all the senses.

Modern Westerners became more familiar with this particular sermon of the Buddha's when its title was used to head Section III of T. S. Eliot's "The Waste Land," one of the seminal poems of the twentieth century, its metaphor a landscape of moral bleakness and its final word *burning*. The Buddha's message in this 2,500-year-old speech is both more positive and intellectually accessible.

**[ALL THINGS, O]{.small}** priests, are on fire. And what, O priests, are all these things which are on fire?

The eye, O priests, is on fire; forms are on fire; eye-consciousness is on fire; impressions received by the eye are on fire; and whatever sensation, []{#part0107.html_page452}pleasant, unpleasant, or indifferent, originates in dependence on impressions received by the eye, that also is on fire.

And with what are these on fire?

With the fire of passion, say I, with the fire of hatred, with the fire of infatuation; with birth, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, misery, grief, and despair are they on fire.

The ear is on fire; sounds are on fire;... the nose is on fire; odors are on fire;... the tongue is on fire; tastes are on fire;... the body is on fire; things tangible are on fire;... the mind is on fire; ideas are on fire;... mind-consciousness is on fire; impressions received by the mind are on fire; and whatever sensation, pleasant, unpleasant, or indifferent, originates in dependence on impressions received by the mind, that also is on fire.

And with what are these on fire?

With the fire of passion, say I, with the fire of hatred, with the fire of infatuation; with birth, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, misery, grief, and despair are they on fire.

Perceiving this, O priests, the learned and noble disciple conceives an aversion for the eye, conceives an aversion for forms, conceives an aversion for eye-consciousness, conceives an aversion for the impressions received by the eye; and whatever sensation, pleasant, unpleasant, or indifferent, originates in dependence on impressions received by the eye, for that also he conceives an aversion. Conceives an aversion for the ear, conceives an aversion for sounds,... conceives an aversion for the nose, conceives an aversion for odors,... conceives an aversion for the tongue, conceives an aversion for tastes,... conceives an aversion for the body, conceives an aversion for things tangible,... conceives an aversion for the mind, conceives an aversion for ideas, conceives an aversion for mind-consciousness, conceives an aversion for the impressions received by the mind; and whatever sensation, pleasant, unpleasant, or indifferent, originates in dependence on impressions received by the mind, for this also he conceives an aversion. And in conceiving this aversion, he becomes divested of passion, and by the absence of passion he becomes free, and when he is free he becomes aware that he is free; and he knows that rebirth is exhausted, that he has lived the holy life, that he has done what it behooved him to do, and that he is no more for this world....
