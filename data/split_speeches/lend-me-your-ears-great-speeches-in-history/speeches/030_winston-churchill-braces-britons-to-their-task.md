# Winston Churchill Braces Britons to Their Task {#part0037.html_c30 .toc}

*"I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat."*
:::

When Winston Churchill addressed Parliament on May 13, 1940, he had just been appointed prime minister, a position that he held from 1940 to 1945 and again from 1951 until his retirement in 1955. His Conservative party sought to ready England for defense in the face of Nazi aggression, and Churchill rallied his country after succeeding Neville Chamberlain, a prime minister who thought he had achieved "peace for our time," in the appeasement of Hitler at Munich in 1938.

Churchill delivered speeches eminently suited for quoting, their memorable phrases ranging from "their finest hour" to "iron curtain." But no orator can guarantee that his prose will survive the editing of history: this 1940 speech about "blood, toil, tears, and sweat" is now often identified by the altered quotation "blood, sweat, and tears." (The editing is apt; "toil" and "sweat" are redundant.) Curiously, common usage prefers to begin sequential phrases with "blood": Otto von Bismarck's warlike 1862 *Eisen und Blut* was also switched around to "blood and iron."

[]{#part0037.html_page144}The German threat, memorably described by Churchill as "a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalogue of human crime," is the foremost concern of the new prime minister. Addressing the House of Commons, he uses repetition and alliteration ("many, many months of struggle and suffering") to pound home the period of stress and sacrifice ahead. Through answers to his countrymen's questions ("You ask, what is our policy?" and "You ask, what is our aim?"), Churchill outlines his intentions for England during the onset of World War II.

**[ON FRIDAY EVENING]{.small}** last I received from His Majesty the mission to form a new administration.

It was the evident will of Parliament and the nation that this should be conceived on the broadest possible basis and that it should include all parties.

I have already completed the most important part of this task. A war cabinet has been formed of five members, representing, with the Labour, Opposition, and Liberals, the unity of the nation.

It was necessary that this should be done in one single day on account of the extreme urgency and rigor of events. Other key positions were filled yesterday. I am submitting a further list to the king tonight. I hope to complete the appointment of principal ministers during tomorrow.

The appointment of other ministers usually takes a little longer. I trust when Parliament meets again this part of my task will be completed and that the administration will be complete in all respects.

I considered it in the public interest to suggest to the Speaker that the House should be summoned today. At the end of today's proceedings, the adjournment of the House will be proposed until May 21 with provision for earlier meeting if need be. Business for that will be notified to MPs at the earliest opportunity.

I now invite the House by a resolution to record its approval of the steps taken and declare its confidence in the new government. The resolution:

"That this House welcomes the formation of a government representing the united and inflexible resolve of the nation to prosecute the war with Germany to a victorious conclusion."

To form an administration of this scale and complexity is a serious undertaking in itself. But we are in the preliminary phase of one of the greatest battles in history. We are in action at many other points---in Norway and in Holland---and we have to be prepared in the []{#part0037.html_page145}Mediterranean. The air battle is continuing, and many preparations have to be made here at home.

In this crisis I think I may be pardoned if I do not address the House at any length today, and I hope that any of my friends and colleagues or former colleagues who are affected by the political reconstruction will make all allowances for any lack of ceremony with which it has been necessary to act.

I say to the House as I said to ministers who have joined this government, I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat. We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have before us many, many months of struggle and suffering.

You ask, what is our policy? I say it is to wage war by land, sea, and air. War with all our might and with all the strength God has given us, and to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy.

You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word. It is victory. Victory at all costs---victory in spite of all terrors---victory, however long and hard the road may be, for without victory there is no survival.

Let that be realized. No survival for the British Empire, no survival for all that the British Empire has stood for, no survival for the urge, the impulse of the ages, that mankind shall move forward toward his goal.

I take up my task in buoyancy and hope. I feel sure that our cause will not be suffered to fail among men.

I feel entitled at this juncture, at this time, to claim the aid of all and to say, "Come then, let us go forward together with our united strength."
