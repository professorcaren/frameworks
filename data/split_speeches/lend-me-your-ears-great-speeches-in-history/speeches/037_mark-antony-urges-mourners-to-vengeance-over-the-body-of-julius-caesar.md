*"If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.... This was the most unkindest cut of all"*
:::

If we can accept Thucydides' recollected account of the funeral oration of Pericles, we can stretch further from accuracy to accept William Shakespeare's version, in his play *Julius Caesar*, of a speech by Mark Antony referred to by historians Plutarch and Dion Cassius.

The technique of the speaker is to seem to agree with what has been said before---in this case by Brutus, tool and front of the conspirators, who had told the crowd of Caesar, "As he was ambitious, I slew him." But the dramatist plants the seeds of doubt by acting against the words, at first subtly imputing dishonor while appearing to concede honor in the previous speaker, and later savaging him with increasing sarcasm overlaying "honorable."

The speaker poses (falsely, as the playwright shows the audience) as "a plain blunt man" without "the power of speech to stir men's blood," who can "only speak right on." Of course, the murdered man's friend speaks obliquely, pulling from his listeners the mutinous calls he professes not to make himself, closing with an egregious bribe. This mostly fictional speech about a factual conqueror is a playwright's lesson in how politicians can manipulate mobs.

[ANTONY]{.small1}. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;

I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.

The evil that men do lives after them;

The good is oft interred with their bones;

So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus

Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:

[]{#part0045.html_page178}If it were so, it was a grievous fault,

And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.

Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest,---

For Brutus is an honorable man;

So are they all, all honorable men;

Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.

He was my friend, faithful and just to me:

But Brutus says he was ambitious;

And Brutus is an honorable man.

He hath brought many captives home to Rome,

Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:

Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?

When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:

Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:

Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;

And Brutus is an honorable man.

You all did see that on the Lupercal

I thrice presented him a kingly crown,

Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?

Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;

And, sure, he is an honorable man.

I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,

But here I am to speak what I do know.

You all did love him once, not without cause:

What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?

O judgment, thou are fled to brutish beasts,

And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;

My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,

And I must pause till it come back to me.

[FIRST CITIZEN]{.small1}. Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.

[SECOND CITIZEN]{.small1}. If you consider rightly of the matter, Caesar has had great wrong.

[THIRD CITIZEN]{.small1}. Has he, masters?

I fear there will a worse come in his place.

[FOURTH CITIZEN]{.small1}. Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;

Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.

[FIRST CITIZEN]{.small1}. If it be found so, some will dear abide it.

[SECOND CITIZEN]{.small1}. Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.

[THIRD CITIZEN]{.small1}. There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.

[FOURTH CITIZEN]{.small1}. N[OW]{.small1} mark him, he begins again to speak.

[]{#part0045.html_page179}A[NTONY]{.small1}. But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world: now lies he there,

And none so poor to do him reverence.

O masters, if I were disposed to stir

Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,

I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong

Who, you all know, are honorable men.

I will not do them wrong; I rather choose

To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,

Than I will wrong such honorable men.

But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;

I found it in his closet; 'tis his will:

Let but the commons hear this testament---

Which pardon me, I do not mean to read---

And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds

And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,

Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,

And, dying, mention it within their wills,

Bequeathing it as a rich legacy

Unto their issue.

[FOURTH CITIZEN]{.small1}. We'll hear the will; read it, Mark Antony.

[ALL]{.small1}. The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will.

[ANTONY]{.small1}. Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;

It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.

You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;

And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar,

It will inflame you, it will make you mad:

'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;

For if you should, O, what would come of it.

[FOURTH CITIZEN]{.small1}. Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony;

You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.

[ANTONY]{.small1}. Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?

I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:

I fear I wrong the honorable men

Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.

[FOURTH CITIZEN]{.small1}. They were traitors: honorable men!

[ALL]{.small1}. The will! the testament!

[SECOND CITIZEN]{.small1}. They were villains, murderers: the will! read the will.

[ANTONY]{.small1}. You will compel me then to read the will?

Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,

[]{#part0045.html_page180}And let me show you him that made the will.

Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?

[ALL]{.small1}. Come down.

[SECOND CITIZEN]{.small1}. Descend. \[*He comes down from the pulpit*.\]

[THIRD CITIZEN]{.small1}. You shall have leave.

[FOURTH CITIZEN]{.small1}. A ring; stand round.

[FIRST CITIZEN]{.small1}. Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.

[SECOND CITIZEN]{.small1}. Room for Antony, most noble Antony.

[ANTONY]{.small1}. Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.

[ALL]{.small1}. Stand back. Room. Bear back.

[ANTONY]{.small1}. If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.

You all do know this mantle: I remember

The first time ever Caesar put it on;

'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,

That day he overcame the Nervii:

Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:

See what a rent the envious Casca made:

Through this the well-belov'd Brutus stabb'd;

And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,

Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,

As rushing out of doors, to be resolved

If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no:

For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:

Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him.

This was the most unkindest cut of all;

For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,

Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,

Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;

And, in his mantle muffling up his face,

Even at the base of Pompey's statue,

Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.

O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!

Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,

Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.

O, now you weep, and I perceive you feel

The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.

Kind souls, what weep you when you but behold

Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,

Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.

[FIRST CITIZEN]{.small1}. O piteous spectacle!

[SECOND CITIZEN]{.small1}. O noble Caesar!

[]{#part0045.html_page181}[THIRD CITIZEN]{.small1}. O woeful day!

[FOURTH CITIZEN]{.small1}. O traitors, villains!

[FIRST CITIZEN]{.small1}. O most bloody sight!

[SECOND CITIZEN]{.small1}. We will be revenged.

[ALL]{.small1}. Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire!

Kill! Slay! Let not a traitor live!

[ANTONY]{.small1}. Stay, countrymen.

[FIRST CITIZEN]{.small1}. Peace there! hear the noble Antony.

[SECOND CITIZEN]{.small1}. We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him.

[ANTONY]{.small1}. Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up To such a sudden flood of mutiny.

They that have done this deed are honorable;

What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,

That made them do it; they are wise and honorable,

And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.

I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts: I am no orator, as Brutus is;

But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,

That love my friend; and that they know full well

That gave me public leave to speak of him:

For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,

Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,

To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;

I tell you that which you yourselves do know;

Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,

And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,

And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony

Would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue

In every wound of Caesar, that should move

The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.

[ALL]{.small1}. We'll mutiny.

[FIRST CITIZEN]{.small1}. We'll burn the house of Brutus.

[THIRD CITIZEN]{.small1}. Away, then! come, seek the conspirators.

[ANTONY]{.small1}. Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.

[ALL]{.small1}. Peace, ho! Hear Antony. Most noble Antony!

[ANTONY]{.small1}. Why, friends, you go to do you know not what:

Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?

Alas, you know not; I must tell you then:

You have forgot the will I told you of.

[ALL]{.small1}. Most true: the will! Let's stay and hear the will.

[]{#part0045.html_page182}[ANTONY]{.small1}. Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.

To every Roman citizen he gives,

To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.

[SECOND CITIZEN]{.small1}. Most noble Caesar! we'll revenge his death.

[THIRD CITIZEN]{.small1}. O royal Caesar!

[ANTONY]{.small1}. Hear me with patience.

[ALL]{.small1}. Peace, ho!

[ANTONY]{.small1}. Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,

His private arbors and new-planted orchards,

On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,

And to your heirs for ever; common pleasures,

To walk abroad and recreate yourselves.

Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?

[FIRST CITIZEN]{.small1}. Never, never. Come, away, away!

We'll burn his body in the holy place,

And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.

Take up the body.

[SECOND CITIZEN]{.small1}. Go fetch fire.

[THIRD CITIZEN]{.small1}. Pluck down benches.

[FOURTH CITIZEN]{.small1}. Pluck down forms, windows, anything.

\[*Exeunt Citizens with the body*.\]

[ANTONY]{.small1}. Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,

Take thou what course thou wilt.
