> *As British Colonial Secretary from 1959 to 1961, Iain Macleod (1913--70) pursued a historic policy of granting independence to the British colonies in Africa more quickly than many Conservatives wished and defying some of the most powerful sectors of the Tory Party. Although he was woundingly described as 'too clever by half' (by the Marquess of Salisbury), he achieved his purpose in ensuring that Britain's withdrawal from most parts of Africa was accomplished with more speed and goodwill than it otherwise would have been.*
>
> *Speaking to the Conservative conference on the day before Harold Macmillan made him chairman of the party and leader of the House of Commons, Macleod `<?pagebreak number="312" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter026.html_p312}defined the British imperial mission and the moral principles on which it was based. Its most memorable phrase was based on Robert Burns:*
>
> *That man to man the whole world o'er*
>
> *Shall brothers be for a' that.*
>
> *Many contemporaries considered Macleod, with his rasping voice, with scorn or passion controlled, the best parliamentary debater of his generation -- and this speech to an audience in which many disagreed violently with his policy was one of his finest.*

At the end of the last war, something like 630 million people lived in the dependent territories of the Crown. Now, that figure is about 40 million. Indeed, when this week started, the figure was 30 million. Think, then, of that change from 630 million and reflect that at the same time, over the same period, Russian imperialism has shackled 100 million men and women who once were free. And when you compare those two records, I hope you will share my indignation that in international forums, in the United Nations itself, most of all in the countries where tyranny itself reigns, our British colonial record should be attacked ...

It has fallen to me to be Colonial Secretary during two of the most tremendous years of advance that the world has ever seen. You must be in no doubt that you are watching one of the great dramas of history, as so many countries thrust forwards through nationalism towards their independence ...

The tightrope of timing which the Colonial Secretary has to walk in every territory every week, sometimes almost every day, is the most difficult of all his tasks -- how you try to reconcile the emerging nationalism of these countries with the need for the surest possible protection for the minority. As you walk this tightrope, you must realize that if you fall from it it will bring disaster and perhaps bloodshed to so many people to whom you stand in a position of trustee.

How, then, do you go forward? On what moral principles should you base your policy, for be very sure that in this field, as in every other field, if your policies are not based on principle they will fail? I `<?pagebreak number="313" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter026.html_p313}can only give you my own personal belief. First, I believe in the rights and duties of men, and that means of all men. But do not ever fall into the error of assuming that, because you give a man better housing, because you give a man better education, because you improve the health services, somehow that will satisfy his craving for basic political rights. It cannot do. Indeed, it is bound to sharpen it.

Remember also that however great your services may have been to a country, however noble the contribution we have made in the five continents of the world to the developing countries has been -- and it has been noble -- that will never always be accepted as a reason why automatically you should govern. We would never have accepted -- we did not accept -- this from the Romans. The Irish never accepted it from us. Be quite sure that the inheritors of the British Empire equally would not accept it from our people. But yet there is a way. Let me remind you of something that I said at last year's Conference when I quoted the Prime Minister of Nigeria. He was referring to the British Colonial record in Nigeria. He said that we had been, first, masters, then leaders, and finally partners, but always friends. This is the answer -- in partnership and in friendship. This can be done.

Secondly, I believe in what our grandfathers would have called the British Imperial mission. It is not yet completed. Since the world began, empires have grown and flourished and decayed, some into a sort of genteel obscurity, some leaving little heritage and culture behind them, some even no more than stones covered by the sand. They are one with Nineveh and Tyre, but we are the only empire leaving behind us a coherent political scheme of development. We are the only people who, with all the hesitations and failures that there have been, are genuinely resolved on turning, to use Harold Macmillan's phrase, an empire into a commonwealth and a commonwealth into a family. This is what we are doing.

... The third principle is that I believe quite simply in the brother-hood of man -- men of all races, of all colours, of all creeds. I think it is this that must be in the centre of our thinking.

And now what lies ahead in this event? It is perhaps strange to an English and to a Welsh audience to quote the greatest of our Scottish `<?pagebreak number="314" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter026.html_p314}native poets, but nobody has put this in simpler or finer words than Burns:

> It is coming yet for a' that,
>
> That man to man the whole world o'er,
>
> Shall brothers be for a' that.

And this is coming. There are foolish men who will deny it, but they will be swept away; but if we are wise then indeed the task of bringing these countries towards their destiny of free and equal partners and friends with us in the Commonwealth of Nations can be a task as exciting, as inspiring and as noble as the creation of empire itself.

> *Macleod became Chancellor of the Exchequer when Edward Heath was elected prime minister in 1970 but died within a month of taking office.*
