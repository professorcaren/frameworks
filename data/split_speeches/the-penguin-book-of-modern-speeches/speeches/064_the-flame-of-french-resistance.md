#### 'The flame of French resistance' {#chapter017.html_pen0001460 .EB10SmallHead}

> *A veteran of the First World War, when he served under Colonel Pétain, General de Gaulle (1890--1970) successfully commanded an armoured division in May 1940 and briefly held the junior post of under-secretary for war under Paul Reynaud, the French prime minister. When the French armies collapsed, Reynaud sent for Pétain, who soon became premier himself and made arrangements for surrender and an armistice. De Gaulle escaped to England to organize the Free French movement and was sentenced to death* in absentia *by a French court.*

> `<?pagebreak number="193" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter017.html_p193}*The Battle of France was over, the Battle of Britain about to begin and the fortunes of the allies against Hitler stood at their lowest ebb as the tall French officer stood before the microphone to rally Frenchmen throughout the world.*

The leaders who, for many years past, have been at the head of the French armed forces have set up a government.

Alleging the defeat of our armies, this government has entered into negotiations with the enemy with a view to bringing about a cessation of hostilities. It is quite true that we were, and still are, overwhelmed by enemy mechanized forces, both on the ground and in the air. It was the tanks, the planes, and the tactics of the Germans, far more than the fact that we were outnumbered, that forced our armies to retreat. It was the German tanks, planes, and tactics that provided the element of surprise which brought our leaders to their present plight.

But has the last word been said? Must we abandon all hope? Is our defeat final and irremediable? To those questions I answer -- No!

Speaking in full knowledge of the facts, I ask you to believe me when I say that the cause of France is not lost. The very factors that brought about our defeat may one day lead us to victory.

For, remember this, France does not stand alone. She is not isolated. Behind her is a vast empire, and she can make common cause with the British Empire, which commands the seas and is continuing the struggle. Like England, she can draw unreservedly on the immense industrial resources of the United States.

This war is not limited to our unfortunate country. The outcome of the struggle has not been decided by the Battle of France. This is a world war. Mistakes have been made, there have been delays and untold suffering, but the fact remains that there still exists in the world everything we need to crush our enemies some day. Today we are crushed by the sheer weight of mechanized force hurled against us, but we can still look to a future in which even greater mechanized force will bring us victory. The destiny of the world is at stake.

I, General de Gaulle, now in London, call on all French officers and men who are at present on British soil, or may be in the future, `<?pagebreak number="194" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter017.html_p194}with or without their arms; I call on all engineers and skilled workmen from the armaments factories who are at present on British soil, or may be in the future, to get in touch with me.

Whatever happens, the flame of French resistance must not and shall not die.

Tomorrow I shall broadcast again from London.

##### II {#chapter017.html_pen0001478 .EB07SmallCapsMediumHead}

Frenchmen must now be fully aware that all ordinary forms of authority have disappeared.

Faced by the bewilderment of my countrymen, by the disintegration of a government in thrall to the enemy, by the fact that the institutions of my country are incapable, at the moment, of functioning, I, General de Gaulle, a French soldier and military leader, realize that I now speak for France.

In the name of France, I make the following solemn declaration:

It is the bounden duty of all Frenchmen who still bear arms to continue the struggle. For them to lay down their arms, to evacuate any position of military importance, or agree to hand over any part of French territory, however small, to enemy control, would be a crime against our country. For the moment I refer particularly to French North Africa -- to the *integrity* of French North Africa.

The Italian armistice is nothing but a clumsy trap. In the Africa of Clauzel, Bugeaud, Lyautey, and Noguès, honour and duty strictly enjoin that the French should refuse to carry out the conditions imposed by the enemy.

The thought that the panic of Bordeaux could make itself felt across the sea is not to be borne.

Soldiers of France, wherever you may be, arise!

> *De Gaulle acted as an inspiration to the French resistance. In June 1943 he became head of the French Committee of National Liberation in Algiers. He landed in Normandy a week after D-Day and marched into Paris on 25 August 1944, while German sharpshooters were still on the roofs.*
