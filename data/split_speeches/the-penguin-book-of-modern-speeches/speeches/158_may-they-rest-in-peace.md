It's an historic day for Russia. Eighty years have passed since the slaying of the last Russian emperor and his family. We have long been silent about this monstrous crime. We must say the truth: the Yekaterinburg massacre has become one of the most shameful pages of our history.

By burying the remains of innocent victims we want to expiate the sins of our ancestors. Guilty are those who committed this heinous crime and those who have been justifying it for decades -- all of us.

We must not lie to ourselves, explaining this senseless cruelty with political goals. The execution of the Romanov family was the result of an irreconcilable split in Russian society. Its results are felt to this day. The burial of the victims' remains is an act of human justice, an expiation of common guilt.

We all bear responsibility for the historical memory of the nation; and that's why I could not fail to come here. I must be here as both an individual and the president.

I bow my head before the victims of the merciless slaying. While building a new Russia we must rely on its historical experience. Many glorious pages of our history are linked with the Romanovs. But also connected with their name is one of the most bitter lessons -- that attempts to change life by violence are doomed.

We must finish this century, which has become the century of blood and lawlessness for Russia, with repentance and reconciliation irrespective of political and religious views and ethnic origin. This is our historic chance. On the eve of the third millennium, we must do it for the sake of our generation, and those to come. Let's remember those innocent victims who have fallen to hatred and violence. May they rest in peace.
