> *Edward Heath* *(1916*--*2005),* *who became British prime minister in 1970, had always been a strong supporter of British entry into the European Common Market. The Schuman plan for a European Iron and Steel Commission was the subject of his maiden speech in 1950. He had been Britain's chief negotiator when Harold Macmillan tried to join the Common Market in 1961 but was foiled by Charles de Gaulle, the French president.*
>
> *Negotiations to join the Common Market began again as soon as Heath became prime minister. There were crucial talks with de Gaulle's successor, Georges Pompidou, in May 1971 which removed many of the obstacles to British membership.*
>
> *When the House of Commons debated the decision of principle of whether to apply for membership in October 1971, both the Labour and Tory parties were split. Heath made the concluding speech of the great debate which marked a decisive turning-point in British history.*

I have sometimes felt that among those who have been in this debate seeking to balance up the advantages and disadvantages there was a `<?pagebreak number="402" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter034.html_p402}desire for a degree of certainty which is never obtainable in human affairs. Hon. Members will not ask for it in their lives, in their own businesses. As a nation we have never hitherto asked for it in a trading agreement or in international affairs, either economic or political. Anyone who studies the length of our trading agreements outside will accept that that is the case ...

It is understandable after ten years of negotiation and frustration that many in debate and many in the country outside have fought and talked in terms of 'we' and 'they'. Some, I think, have been overwhelmed by a fear that this country in an organization such as the Community must always be dominated by 'they'. That is certainly not how the rest of the Community sees it. But we are approaching the point where, if this House so decides tonight, it will become just as much our Community as their Community. We shall be partners, or shall be cooperating, and we shall be trying to find common solutions to common problems of all the members of an enlarged Community.

We have confidence that we can benefit as well as contribute, that we can further our own interests and the interests of the Community at one and the same time. After all, the leaders of all three parties in this House accept the principle of entry into the European Community, as the Right Hon. Gentleman reaffirmed this afternoon. The Community is not governed by any particular party ideology. How can it be, with a Socialist Government in the Federal Republic, with a Right-wing Government in France, with a coalition in Italy containing Socialists? Of course not. What is more, all the opposition parties in the member countries of the Community support membership of the Community just as much as the governing parties ...

Surely we must consider the consequences of staying out. We cannot delude ourselves that an early chance would be given us to take the decision again. We should be denying ourselves and succeeding generations the opportunities which are available to us in so many spheres; opportunities which we ourselves in this country have to seize. We should be leaving so many aspects of matters affecting our daily lives to be settled outside our own influence. That surely cannot `<?pagebreak number="403" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter034.html_p403}be acceptable to us. We should be denying to Europe, also -- let us look outside these shores for a moment -- its full potential, its opportunities of developing economically and politically, maintaining its security, and securing for all its people a higher standard of prosperity.

All the consequences of that for many millions of people in Europe must be recognized tonight in the decision the House is taking. In addition, many projects for the future of Europe have been long delayed. There has been great uncertainty, and tonight all that can be removed -- (*Hon. Members: 'No.'*)

Throughout my political career it is well known that I have had the vision of a Britain in a united Europe; a Britain which would be united economically to Europe and which would be able to influence decisions affecting our own future, and which would enjoy a better standard of life and a fuller life. I have worked for a Europe which will play an increasing part in meeting the needs of those parts of the world which still lie in the shadow of want ... I want Britain as a member of a Europe which is united politically, and which will enjoy lasting peace and the greater security which would ensue.

Nor do I believe that the vision of Europe -- and the Right Hon. Gentleman raised this specific point -- is an unworthy vision, or an ignoble vision or an unworthy cause for which to have worked -- (*Interruption.*) I have always made it absolutely plain to the British people that consent to this course would be given by Parliament -- (*Hon. Members: 'Resign.'*) Parliament is the Parliament of all the people.

When we came to the end of the negotiations in 1963, after the veto had been imposed, the negotiator on behalf of India said:

> When you left India some people wept. And when you leave Europe tonight some will weep. And there is no other people in the world of whom these things could be said.

That was a tribute from the Indian to the British. But tonight when this House endorses this Motion many millions of people right across the world will rejoice that we have taken our rightful place in a truly united Europe.

> `<?pagebreak number="404" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter034.html_p404}*Sixty-seven Labour MPs defied the party whip and voted with the Tories. Another twenty abstained. Acceptance of applying for entry to Europe was passed by a majority of 112. The European Community Bill passed through the Commons in 1972 by seventeen votes. Britain became a member of the European Economic Community on 1 January 1973.*
