#### 'At our best when at our boldest' {#chapter045.html_pen0004473 .EB10SmallHead}

> *On the night before this speech, Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's director of communications and strategy, Blair's pollster Phillip Gould and policy adviser Liz Lloyd were up until 3 a.m. going through the speech line by line and trying to get in more 'colour and texture'. They thought that it was in good shape. Blair was up at around six. Campbell saw him at seven and the prime minister 'was pretty happy with it. He felt it was the most rounded intellectual speech of the lot'. This was the final section. Note the verbless sentences which mark some modern speeches.*

`<?pagebreak number="544" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter045.html_p544}Up to 1997, do you know how many years of the twentieth century Labour was in power with a substantial majority?

Nine. By the end of this Parliament, we will have doubled it.

We learnt the hard way.

But now we have to show that we have the capacity not only to learn but to transform, to show what a liberated modern social democracy can do.

We can do it. I'm an optimist.

Why?

Because there is change happening.

Ten years ago people asked would Labour ever win again.

Now, they ask it of the Tories.

Ten years ago, they asked if we were fit to manage the economy.

Now, thanks to the vision and brilliance of Gordon Brown, we have succeeded beyond any previous Labour or Tory government. Not by chance.

Every part of it -- from the first years of discipline, through to Bank of England independence through to reform of tax and benefits to make work pay -- was a bold choice.

The right wing never deserved their reputation for economic competence.

And we've made sure they'll never have exclusive rights to it again.

Ten years ago, claims that the minimum wage would cost a million jobs were the centrepiece of John Major's election campaign: now it's the law, business and trade unions agree it, and the Tories have to pretend they were in favour of it all along.

At our best when at our boldest.

For four elections, anyone who said investment before tax cuts was brave but doomed.

In 2001, we did it and it is those who oppose the investment who are on the run.

The New Deal was savaged by the Tories, challenged politically, challenged legally, challenged by business.

Now it's in its sixth year, over a million people have been helped by it and not one Tory candidate dares to stand up and say we should abolish it.

`<?pagebreak number="545" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter045.html_p545}At our best when at our boldest.

Remember how devolution would break up Britain?

And now there is a Scottish Parliament and a Welsh Assembly, the nationalists are running from their separatism and not a single party in Britain proposes going back. And in Northern Ireland, for all the difficulties, Republicans and Unionists sit in government together and the principle of consent is accepted North and South on the island of Ireland for the first time in eighty years.

At our best when at our boldest.

And remember how for 100 years we tried to reform the House of Lords and now the reform is happening, the hereditary peers are leaving and the attack is that it doesn't go far enough?

The equal age of consent passed massively in the House of Commons.

The first black Cabinet minister. Record numbers of women Cabinet ministers.

Record numbers of women MPs.

From progress here to life and death, abroad, it is happening.

A month ago I visited Beira District Hospital in Mozambique. There are as many doctors in the whole of Mozambique as there are in Oldham. I saw four children to a bed, sick with malaria. Nurses dying of AIDS faster than others can be recruited. Tens of thousands of children dying in that country needlessly every year.

I asked a doctor: What hope is there? Britain is our hope, he said. Thanks to you we have debt relief. Thanks to you we have new programmes to fight AIDS and malaria. Thanks to you the docks at Maputo are being rebuilt and we can sell our goods abroad.

When you tire of knocking on the door, putting the leaflet in the envelope, wonder what it's all about and what it's all for, reflect on that doctor, feel proud of what you do, and understand that's what we elect a Labour government for.

We haven't just nailed the myths about Labour of old; we've created some legend of achievement about New Labour too.

We've been at our best when we've been at our boldest.

And now we need to be again.

And all it takes is for us to do what we believe in.

`<?pagebreak number="546" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter045.html_p546}We believe in a school system of equal opportunity for all. But we don't yet have it.

We believe in an NHS with equal access for all; but not all get it.

We believe in punishing the guilty and acquitting the innocent but it's not what happens.

We believe in ridding Britain of child poverty but children are still poor.

We believe in Europe but we're not yet at the centre of it.

There's nothing wrong with the old principles but if the old ways worked, they'd have worked by now.

If you believe in social justice, in solidarity, in equality of opportunity and responsibility, then believe in the reforms to get us there.

Now is the time.

To quicken the march of progress not mark time.

What started with the renewal of the Labour Party only ends with the renewal of Britain.

Pessimism or hope

Despair or confidence

Decline or renewal

At our best when at our boldest.

This is not the time to abandon our journey of modernization but to see it through.
