## Joseph McCarthy Wheeling, West Virginia, 20 February 1950 {#chapter023.html_pen0001950 .EB04MainHead}

#### 'I have in my hand ...' {#chapter023.html_pen0001954 .EB10SmallHead}

> *Joseph McCarthy (1908--57), the junior Republican senator from Wisconsin, began his career as America's leading Red hunter on 9 February 1950, when he made this speech at the McLure Hotel in Wheeling.*
>
> *McCarthy's accusation that fifty-seven members of the State Department were card-carrying members of the Communist Party instantly became national news and provoked denials from the president and the State Department.*
>
> *Controversy about what McCarthy really said raged for years. This version of his infamous speech is taken from the statement he made on the Senate floor on 20 February, when he put into the Congressional record a copy of what he really said at Wheeling.*

Today we are engaged in a final, all-out battle between communistic atheism and Christianity. The modern champions of communism have selected this as the time. And, ladies and gentlemen, the chips are down -- they are truly down ...

Can there be anyone here tonight who is so blind as to say that the `<?pagebreak number="245" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter023.html_p245}war is not on? Can there be anyone who fails to realize that the Communist world has said, 'The time is now' -- that this is the time for the showdown between the democratic Christian world and the Communist atheistic world?

Unless we face this fact, we shall pay the price that must be paid by those who wait too long.

Six years ago, at the time of the first conference to map out the peace -- Dumbarton Oaks -- there was within the Soviet orbit 180 million people. Lined up on the antitotalitarian side there were in the world at that time roughly 1,625 million people. Today, only six years later, there are 800 million people under the absolute domination of Soviet Russia -- an increase of over 400 per cent. On our side, the figure has shrunk to around 500 million. In other words, in less than six years the odds have changed from 9 to 1 in our favour to 8 to 5 against us. This indicates the swiftness of the tempo of Communist victories and American defeats in the Cold War. As one of our outstanding historical figures once said, 'When a great democracy is destroyed, it will not be because of enemies from without, but rather because of enemies from within.'

The truth of this statement is becoming terrifyingly clear as we see this country each day losing on every front.

At war's end we were physically the strongest nation on earth and, at least potentially, the most powerful intellectually and morally. Ours could have been the honour of being a beacon in the desert of destruction, a shining living proof that civilization was not ready to destroy itself. Unfortunately, we have failed miserably and tragically to arise to the opportunity.

The reason why we find ourselves in a position of impotency is not because our only powerful potential enemy has sent men to invade our shores, but rather because of the traitorous actions of those who have been treated so well by this Nation. It has not been the less fortunate or members of minority groups who have been selling this Nation out, but rather those who have had all the benefits that the wealthiest nation on earth has had to offer -- the finest homes, the finest college education, and the finest jobs in Government we can give.

`<?pagebreak number="246" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter023.html_p246}This is glaringly true in the State Department. There the bright young men who are born with silver spoons in their mouths are the ones who have been worst ...

I have in my hand fifty-seven cases of individuals who would appear to be either card-carrying members or certainly loyal to the Communist Party, but who nevertheless are still helping to shape our foreign policy ...

One of the important reasons for the graft, the corruption, the dishonesty, the disloyalty, the treason in high Government positions -- one of the most important reasons why this continues is a lack of moral uprising on the part of the 140 million American people. In the light of history, however, this is not hard to explain.

It is the result of an emotional hangover and a temporary moral lapse which follows every war. It is the apathy to evil which people who have been subjected to the tremendous evils of war feel. As the people of the world see mass murder, the destruction of defenceless and innocent people, and all of the crime and lack of morals which go with war, they become numb and apathetic. It has always been thus after war.

However, the morals of our people have not been destroyed. They still exist. This cloak of numbness and apathy has only needed a spark to rekindle them. Happily, this spark has finally been supplied.

As you know, very recently the Secretary of State \[Dean Acheson\] proclaimed his loyalty to a man guilty of what has always been considered as the most abominable of all crimes -- of being a traitor to the people who gave him a position of great trust \[Alger Hiss\]. The Secretary of State in attempting to justify his continued devotion to the man who sold out the Christian world to the atheistic world, referred to Christ's Sermon on the Mount as a justification and reason therefor, and the reaction of the American people to this would have made the heart of Abraham Lincoln happy.

When this pompous diplomat in striped pants, with a phony British accent, proclaimed to the American people that Christ on the Mount endorsed communism, high treason, and betrayal of a sacred trust, the blasphemy was so great that it awakened the dormant indignation of the American people.

He has lighted the spark which is resulting in a moral uprising and `<?pagebreak number="247" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter023.html_p247}will end only when the whole sorry mess of twisted, warped thinkers are swept from the national scene so that we may have a new birth of national honesty and decency in Government.

> *The smear tactics of McCarthy and his philistine contempt for intellectuals did untold damage to the American tradition of freedom of thought. He even denounced General George Marshall as a front man for Communism.*
>
> *McCarthyism, the practice of accusing individuals of belonging to Communist front organizations with little evidence for the accusation, destroyed the careers of many men and women and created a sense of Red menace which won the 1952 election for the Republicans.*
>
> *Then McCarthy sought to discredit the army. The army demonstrated that McCarthy had sought preferential treatment for one of his aides. A Senate motion of censure condemned McCarthy's conduct in 1954 and he discredited his cause a few days later by attacking President Eisenhower by name.*
