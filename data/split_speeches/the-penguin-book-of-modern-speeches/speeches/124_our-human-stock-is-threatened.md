> *Sir Keith Joseph* *(1918*--*94)* *was Secretary of State for Social Services in Edward Heath's Conservative government from 1970 to 1974. He was an intellectual, a fellow of All Souls, Oxford, and a One-Nation Tory who became disillusioned `<?pagebreak number="406" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter034.html_p406}by Heath's policies which led to defeat in 1974. He founded the Centre for Policy Studies with Margaret Thatcher and challenged Conservative economic and social philosophy from the right.*
>
> *Joseph was a serious candidate to lead the party in the event of a challenge to Heath but the uproar created by this speech, mostly on the moral or spiritual state of the nation, in which he advocated restraint on the breeding capacities of the poorest social classes, effectively ended any ambition he may have held to lead his party. 'Our human stock is threatened,' he declared*. *(Joseph protested that he had been referring to children born to unmarried or single parent, teenage households* NOT NOT NOT *-- as he wrote in capital letters in* The Times -- *because they were in solo-economic classes 4 and 5, but the damage was done and he had failed to check his statistics*.*)*
>
> *Joseph became the main supporter of Margaret Thatcher who beat Heath in the 1975 Tory leadership election. He was her first Industry Secretary from 1979 to 1981 and was Secretary of State for Education from 1981 to 1986.*

The facile rhetoric of absolute liberty has become a cover for irresponsibility; instant social protest an excuse for anti-social behaviour.

The old virtues of patriotism and national pride have been denigrated in the name of internationalism, love of all our fellow men. But no one can love mankind if he does not love his own countrymen.

It was the radical socialist writer and patriot, the late George Orwell, who described the left-wing intellectuals as men motivated primarily by hatred of their own country. Socialists who spoke most about brotherhood of man could not bear their fellow Englishmen, he complained. Their well-orchestrated sneers from their strongpoint in the educational system and media have weakened the national will to transmit to future generations those values, standards and aspirations which made England admired the world over.

It is just because their message is that self-discipline is out of date and that the poor cannot be expected to help themselves, that they want the state to do more. That is why they believe in state ownership and control of economic life, education, health. Their wish to end parental choice in where and how their children shall be educated, in spending their money on better education and health for their children instead of on a new car, leisure, pleasure, is all part of `<?pagebreak number="407" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter034.html_p407}the attempt to diminish self and self-discipline and real freedoms in favour of the state, ruled by socialists -- the new class, as one disillusioned Communist leader called them.

Of course I shall be misrepresented, but let me ward off what misunderstanding I can. I am not saying that we should not help the poor, far from it. But the only real lasting help we can give to the poor is helping them to help themselves; to do the opposite, to create more dependence, is to destroy them morally while throwing an unfair burden on society. The populist rulers of Rome thought they had hit on a foolproof method of achieving a permanent curb on their patrician rivals when they created a dependent proletariat relying on them for bread and circuses: but in the end it destroyed the political stability of Rome, and so Rome itself fell, destroyed from inside.

Are we to be destroyed from inside too, a country which successfully repelled and destroyed Philip of Spain, Napoleon, the Kaiser, Hitler, are we to be destroyed by ideas, mischievous, wrongheaded, debilitating, yet seductive because they are fashionable and promise so much on the cheap?

It is up to us. History is not made by abstract forces, or classes; it is made by people. If we have the moral courage to say what we believe to be true, right and good, the people will be with us.

Let us take inspiration from that admirable woman Mary Whitehouse. I do not accept all her ideas, she will not accept all mine. Yet we can see in her a shining example of what one person can do singlehandedly when inspired by faith and compassion. An unknown middle-aged woman, a schoolteacher in the Midlands, set out to protect adolescents against the permissiveness of our time.

Look at the scale of the opposing forces. On the one side, the whole of the new establishment with their sharp words and sneers poised; against them stood this one middle-aged woman. Today her name is a household word, made famous by the very assaults of her by her enemies. She has mobilized and given fresh heart to many who see where this current fashion is leading. Her book, *Who Does She Think She Is?*, took its title from the outraged cry of an acolyte of the new hierarchy, who asked how an unknown woman dare speak up against the BBC, the educators and false shepherds.

`<?pagebreak number="408" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter034.html_p408}We too can take courage from her, and dedicate ourselves to fighting back on issues which will decide the nation's future far more than economics, however important it remains. And I welcome the opportunity to express my admiration for another brave woman with us tonight, Mrs Jill Knight, who speaks up when others prefer discretion in public and speak their minds only in private.

What are we to do? Are we to place it all in the lap of the government, the police, the courts? No, not all.

Gladstone, who entered politics as a field for moral endeavour, and never forgot the supremacy of the moral over the expedient, put the matter cogently: he argued that his colleagues were right in thinking that 'there are great evils in the state of society, but wrong when they think them so superficial that they can be cured by legislation'. How well he understood matters too serious to be left to government!

We must do more as Tories to make our voices heard and our influence felt, as a party, as people in public life, high or lowly, in religious life, on councils, voluntary bodies, educational institutions. The arguments are on our side and we have good friends among the teachers, the sociologists, the psychologists, if only we will call on them, give the lead for them to follow.

We must fight the battle of ideas in every school, university, publication, committee, TV studio even if we have to struggle for our toehold there. We have the truth -- if we fail to make it shine clear, we shall be to blame no less than the exploiters, the casuists, the commercializers.

There is much for government to do as well. But we shall need intellectual as well as moral courage to grapple with the dilemmas inherent in the remoralization of public life. I shall confine myself to one example here, because I have been talking longer than you may have bargained for already.

The balance of our population, our human stock is threatened. A recent article in *Poverty*, published by the Child Poverty Action Group, showed that a high and rising proportion of children are being born to mothers least fitted to bring children into the world and bring them up. They are born to mothers who were first pregnant `<?pagebreak number="409" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter034.html_p409}in adolescence in social classes four and five. Many of these girls are unmarried, many are deserted or divorced or soon will be. Some are of low intelligence, most of low educational attainment.

They are unlikely to be able to give children the stable emotional background, the consistent combination of love and firmness which are more important than riches. They are producing problem children, the future unmarried mothers, delinquents, denizens of our borstals, subnormal educational establishments, prisons, hostels for drifters. Yet, these mothers, the under-twenties in many cases, single parents, from classes four and five, are now producing a third of all births. A high proportion of these births are a tragedy for the mother, the child and for us.

Yet what shall we do? If we do nothing, the nation moves towards degeneration, however much resources we pour into preventative work and the over-burdened educational system. It is all the more serious when we think of the loss of people with talent and initiative through emigration as our semi-socialism deprives them of adequate opportunities, rewards and satisfaction.

Yet proposals to extend birth control facilities to these classes of people, particularly the young unmarried girls, the potential young unmarried mothers, evokes entirely understandable moral opposition. Is it not condoning immorality? I suppose it is. But which is the lesser evil, until we are able to remoralize whole groups of classes of people, undoing the harm done when already weak restraints on strong instincts are further weakened by permissiveness in television, in films, on bookstalls? ...

\[According to the Press Association, Sir Keith, at this point in his speech, added a passage to the prepared text 'in view of misunderstandings'.\]

The worship of instinct, of spontaneity, the rejection of self-discipline, is not progress: it is degeneration.

It was Freud who argued that repression of instincts is the price we pay for civilization. He considered the price well paid. So can we, now. But we must see the dilemmas, we must argue it out among ourselves to find a way through these moral dilemmas, while we fight for our ideals in wider form through words and deeds. But you may `<?pagebreak number="410" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter034.html_p410}ask what can fallible politicians in short-lived governments do in the face of all these tidal forces? Most of what needs to be done, I have stressed, is for individuals as themselves, and as members of all manner of bodies. But some tasks are for government, and to these I will return on a future occasion.

This could be a watershed in our national existence. Are we to move towards moral decline, reflected and intensified by economic decline, by the corrosive effects of inflation? Or can we remoralize our national life in which the economy is an integral part? It is up to us, to people like you and me.
