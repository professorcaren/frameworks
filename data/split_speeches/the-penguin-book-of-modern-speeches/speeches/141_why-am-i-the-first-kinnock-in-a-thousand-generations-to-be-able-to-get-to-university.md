> *Even his rivals acknowledged that Neil Kinnock, in his first election as leader of the Labour Party in 1987, fought an energetic and effective campaign. That was particularly true on television where his party political broadcasts were made by Hugh Hudson, the celebrated director of the Oscar-winning* Chariots of Fire.
>
> *The most memorable of the television broadcasts showed Kinnock and Glenys, his wife, strolling in the hills above Llandudno on the North Wales coast, and included extracts from this speech to the Welsh Labour Party.*
>
> *The rousing passion of his speech and the emotional atmosphere in the packed conference hall became a hallmark of Kinnock's election rallies and demonstrated that, when he spoke from the soul rather than a sanitized script prepared so as not to frighten away potential voters with the bogy of a socialist government, he was the greatest British orator of his generation.*

We are democratic socialists. We care all the time. We don't think it's a soft sentiment, we don't think it's 'wet'.

We think that care is the essence of strength.

And we believe that because we know that strength without care is savage and brutal and selfish.

Strength with care is compassion -- the practical action that is needed to help people lift themselves to their full stature.

That's real care -- it is not soft or weak. It is tough and strong.

But where do we get that strength to provide that care?

Do we wait for some stroke of good fortune, some benign giant, some socially conscious Samson to come along and pick up the wretched of the earth?

Of course we don't.

We cooperate, we collect together, we coordinate so that everyone can contribute and everyone can benefit, everyone has responsibilities, `<?pagebreak number="458" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter039.html_p458}everyone has rights. That is how we put care into action. That is how we make the weak strong, that is how we lift the needy, that is how we make the sick whole, that is how we give talent the chance to flourish, that is how we turn the unemployed claimant into the working contributor.

We do it together. It is called collective strength, collective care. And its whole purpose is individual freedom.

When we speak of collective strength and collective freedom, collectively achieved, we are not fulfilling that nightmare that Mrs Thatcher tries to paint, and all her predecessors have tried to saddle us with.

We're not talking about uniformity; we're not talking about regimentation; we're not talking about *conformity* -- that's their creed. The uniformity of the dole queue; the regimentation of the unemployed young and their compulsory work schemes. The *conformity* of people who will work in conditions, and take orders, and accept pay *because of* mass unemployment that they would laugh at in a free society with full employment.

That kind of freedom for the individual, that kind of liberty can't be secured by most of the people for most of the time if they're just left to themselves, isolated, stranded, with their whole life chances dependent upon luck!

Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university? Why is Glenys the first woman in her family in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?

Was it because *all* our predecessors were 'thick'? Did they lack talent -- those people who could sing, and play, and recite and write poetry; those people who could make wonderful, beautiful things with their hands; those people who could dream dreams, see visions; those people who had such a sense of perception as to know in times so brutal, so oppressive, that they could win their way out of that by coming together?

Were those people not university material? Couldn't they have knocked off all their A-levels in an afternoon?

But why didn't they get it?

Was it because they were weak? -- those people who could work eight hours underground and then come up and play football?

`<?pagebreak number="459" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter039.html_p459}Weak? Those women who could survive eleven childbearings, were they weak? Those people who could stand with their backs and their legs straight and face the people who had control over their lives, the ones who owned their workplaces and tried to own them, and tell them, 'No. I won't take your orders.' Were they weak?

Does anybody really think that they didn't get what we had because they didn't have the talent, or the strength, or the endurance, or the commitment?

Of course not. It was because there was no platform upon which they could stand; no arrangement for their neighbours to subscribe to their welfare; no method by which the communities could translate their desires for those individuals into provision for those individuals.

And now, Mrs Thatcher, by dint of privatization, and means test, and deprivation, and division, wants to nudge us back into the situation where everybody can either stand on their own feet, or live on their knees.

> *The 1987 British general election marked the high noon of Margaret Thatcher's three governments and she won her third victory -- but Kinnock destroyed the Alliance of the Liberals and the Social Democrats as the main alternative to the Tories. The American politician Joe Biden was later to pinch a theme from Kinnock's speech and ask 'Why am I the fourteenth Joe Biden ...?' Kinnock lost his second general election in 1992 and subsequently resigned as leader of the Labour Party.*
