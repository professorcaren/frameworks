> *Martin Luther King (1929--68), a black American Baptist pastor, was the right man in the right place at a moment when history demanded a man of stature to become the leader of his people. That moment occurred in 1954, when King led the victorious campaign against segregated seating in Montgomery's buses. Never before in American history had any black leader succeeded in carrying out a prolonged and victorious attack upon oppression by white people. King subsequently led the civil-rights movement, insisting, like Gandhi, on non-violence.*
>
> *About a thousand black Americans packed Holt Street Baptist Church on the night of 5 December 1955, the day when the first campaign started. Outside, another five thousand, mainly labourers and servants, listened to the speeches over loudspeakers. With only twenty minutes to prepare his speech, King wrote later that he decided that he would seek to arouse his followers to action by insisting their self-respect was at stake and that if they accepted such injustices without protesting they `<?pagebreak number="267" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter023.html_p267}would betray their own sense of dignity and the eternal edicts of God himself. 'But I would balance this with a strong affirmation of the Christian doctrine of love.'*
>
> *As King and Ralph Abernathy entered the church together, all heads turned. King led the congregation in singing 'Onward Christian Soldiers' and 'Leaning on the Everlasting Arms'. After prayers and a reading from the Scriptures, he advanced to the lectern. As the audience applauded and television cameras began to shoot from all sides, the crowd grew quiet. Then King, speaking without notes or a manuscript, delivered the speech that first drew him to national attention.*

We're here this evening for serious business. We're here in a general sense because first and foremost, we are American citizens, and we are determined to acquire our citizenship to the fullness of its meaning. We are here also because of our deep-seated belief that democracy transformed from thin paper to thick action is the greatest form of government on earth.

There comes a time that people get tired. We are here this evening to say to those who have mistreated us so long that we are tired -- tired of being segregated and humiliated; tired of being kicked about by the brutal feet of oppression.

There comes a time my friends when people get tired of being plunged across the abyss of humiliation, when they experience the bleakness of nagging despair. There comes a time when people get tired of being pushed out of the glimmering sunlight of last July and left standing amid the piercing chill of an Alpine November.

We had no alternative but to protest. For many years, we have shown amazing patience. We have sometimes given our white brothers the feeling that we liked the way we were being treated. But we come here tonight to be saved from that patience that makes us patient with anything less than freedom and justice.

One of the great glories of democracy is the right to protest for right.

These organizations \[White Citizens' Councils and the Ku Klux Klan\] are protesting for the perpetuation of injustice in the community, we are protesting for the birth of justice in the community. Their methods lead to violence and lawlessness. But in our protest there will be no cross burnings. No white person will be taken from `<?pagebreak number="268" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter023.html_p268}his home by a hooded Negro mob and brutally murdered. There will be no threats and intimidation. We will be guided by the highest principles of law and order.

Our method will be that of persuasion, not coercion. We will only say to the people, 'Let your conscience be your guide.' Our actions must be guided by the deepest principles of our Christian faith. Love must be our regulating ideal. Once again we must hear the words of Jesus echoing across the centuries ('Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, and pray for them that despitefully use you'). If we fail to do this our protest will end up as a meaningless drama on the stage of history, and its memory will be shrouded with the ugly garments of shame. In spite of the mistreatment that we have confronted we must not become bitter, and end up by hating our white brothers. As Booker T. Washington said, 'Let no man pull you so low as to make you hate him.'

We are not wrong in what we are doing. If we are wrong, the Supreme Court of this nation is wrong. If we are wrong, the Constitution of the United States is wrong. If we are wrong, God Almighty is wrong. If we are wrong, Jesus of Nazareth was merely a Utopian dreamer who never came down to earth.

If you will protest courageously, and yet with dignity and Christian love, when the history books are written in future generations, the historians will have to pause and say, 'There lived a great people -- a black people -- who injected new meaning and dignity into the veins of civilization.' This is our challenge and our overwhelming responsibility.
