#### 'This has hurt too many innocent people' {#chapter044.html_pen0004250 .EB10SmallHead}

> *One year after he started his second term as president in January 1997, President Clinton learned that Kenneth Starr was investigating accusations that he had conducted a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern, in 1995 and then tried to cover it up. After months of investigation, rumours and Clinton's denial that he had had sexual relations with 'that woman', Clinton was forced to admit to a relationship that was 'not appropriate' with the twenty-five-year-old Miss Lewinsky. The confession was made in a four-minute speech seen by nearly two-thirds of Americans. No president had ever been forced to address such personal issues in a nationally televised speech. Clinton was as defiant as he was contrite.*

This afternoon in this room, from this chair, I testified before the Office of Independent Counsel and the grand jury. I answered their questions truthfully, including questions about my private life, questions no American citizen would ever want to answer.

Still, I must take complete responsibility for all my actions, both public and private. And that is why I am speaking to you tonight.

As you know, in a deposition in January, I was asked questions about my relationship with Monica Lewinsky. While my answers were legally accurate, I did not volunteer information.

Indeed, I did have a relationship with Ms Lewinsky that was not appropriate. In fact, it was wrong. It constituted a critical lapse in judgement and a personal failure on my part for which I am solely and completely responsible.

But I told the grand jury today and I say to you now that at no time did I ask anyone to lie, to hide or destroy evidence or to take any other unlawful action.

I know that my public comments and my silence about this matter gave a false impression.

I misled people, including even my wife. I deeply regret that.

`<?pagebreak number="524" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter044.html_p524}I can only tell you I was motivated by many factors. First by a desire to protect myself from the embarrassment of my own conduct. I was also very concerned about protecting my family. The fact that these questions were being asked in a politically inspired lawsuit, which has since been dismissed, was a consideration, too.

In addition, I had real and serious concerns about an independent counsel investigation that began with private business dealings twenty years ago, dealings, I might add, about which an independent federal agency found no evidence of any wrongdoing by me or my wife over two years ago.

The independent counsel investigation moved on to my staff and friends, then into my private life. And now the investigation itself is under investigation. This has gone on too long, cost too much and hurt too many innocent people.

Now, this matter is between me, the two people I love most -- my wife and our daughter -- and our God.

I must put it right, and I am prepared to do whatever it takes to do so. Nothing is more important to me personally.

But it is private, and I intend to reclaim my family life for my family. It's nobody's business but ours.

Even presidents have private lives. It is time to stop the pursuit of personal destruction and the prying into private lives and get on with our national life.

Our country has been distracted by this matter for too long, and I take my responsibility for my part in all of this. That is all I can do. Now it is time -- in fact, it is past time -- to move on. We have important work to do, real opportunities to seize, real problems to solve, real security matters to face.

And so tonight, I ask you to turn away from the spectacle of the past seven months, to repair the fabric of our national discourse and to return our attention to all the challenges and all the promise of the next American century. Thank you for watching. And good night.
