#### 'We shall overcome' {#chapter031.html_pen0002862 .EB10SmallHead}

> *Although his achievements were to be overshadowed by Vietnam, Lyndon Johnson's five years in the White House saw the completion of civil-rights legislation, the Federal Education Act of 1965 and the establishment of Medicare in pursuit of his ideal of The Great Society.*
>
> *As he contemplated the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Johnson was worried about the reaction of Congress but was persuaded that a speech to the House would not be interpreted as a sign of panic and would also show that he was being bipartisan.*
>
> *At 8 p.m. and due to deliver his speech at 9 p.m., he was still writing. The speech never made the teleprompter and was read from a rough copy. As he came to the most famous section, Johnson paused for breath. 'In that fleeting moment,' he wrote in his memoirs, 'my thoughts turned to the picket lines in Birmingham, the sit-ins in North Carolina, the marches in Selma. A picture rose before my eyes -- a picture of blacks and whites marching together, side by side, chanting and singing the anthem of the civil rights movement. I raised my arms.'*

Mr Speaker, Mr President, members of the Congress, I speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy.

I urge every member of both parties, Americans of all religions and of all colours, from every section of this country, to join me in that cause.

`<?pagebreak number="359" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter031.html_p359}At times, history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning-point in man's unending search for freedom.

So it was at Lexington and Concord. So it was a century ago at Appomattox. So it was last week in Selma, Alabama.

There, long suffering men and women peacefully protested the denial of their rights as Americans. Many were brutally assaulted. One good man -- a man of God -- was killed.

There is no cause for pride in what has happened in Selma. There is no cause for self-satisfaction in the long denial of equal rights of millions of Americans. But there is cause for hope and for faith in our democracy in what is happening here tonight.

For the cries of pain and the hymns of oppressed people have summoned into convocation all the majesty of great Government -- the Government of the greatest nation on earth.

Our mission is at once the oldest and the most basic of this country -- to right wrong, to do justice, to serve man.

In our time we have come to live with the moments of great crisis. Our lives have been marked with debate about great issues, issues of war and peace, issues of prosperity and depression.

But rarely in any time does an issue bare the secret heart of America itself. Rarely are we met with a challenge, not to our growth or abundance, or our welfare or our security, but rather to the values and the purposes and the meaning of our beloved nation.

The issue of equal rights for American Negroes is such an issue.

And should we defeat every enemy, and should we double our wealth and conquer the stars, and still be unequal to this issue, then we will have failed as a people and as a nation.

For, with a country as with a person, 'What is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?'

There is no Negro problem. There is no Southern problem. There is no Northern problem. There is only an American problem.

And we are met here tonight as Americans -- not as Democrats or Republicans; we're met here as Americans to solve that problem.

This was the first nation in the history of the world to be founded with a purpose. The great phrases of that purpose still sound in every American heart, North and South:

`<?pagebreak number="360" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter031.html_p360}'All men are created equal.' 'Government by consent of the governed.' 'Give me liberty or give me death.'

And those are not just clever words, and those are not just empty theories.

In their name Americans have fought and died for two centuries and tonight around the world they stand there as guardians of our liberty risking their lives.

Those words are promised to every citizen that he shall share in the dignity of man. This dignity cannot be found in a man's possessions. It cannot be found in his power or in his position: it really rests on his right to be treated as a man equal in opportunity to all others.

It says that he shall share in freedom. He shall choose his leaders, educate his children, provide for his family according to his ability and his merits as a human being.

To apply any other test, to deny a man his hopes because of his colour or race or his religion or the place of his birth is not only to do injustice, it is to deny America and to dishonour the dead who gave their lives for American freedom.

Our fathers believed that if this noble view of the rights of man was to flourish it must be rooted in democracy. The most basic right of all was the right to choose your own leaders.

The history of this country in large measure is the history of expansion of that right to all of our people. Many of the issues of civil rights are very complex and most difficult. But about this there can and should be no argument: every American citizen must have an equal right to vote.

There is no reason which can excuse the denial of that right. There is no duty which weighs more heavily on us than the duty we have to insure that right. Yet the harsh fact is that in many places in this country men and women are kept from voting simply because they are Negroes.

Every device of which human ingenuity is capable has been used to deny this right. The Negro citizen may go to register only to be told that the day is wrong, or the hour is late, or the official in charge is absent.

And if he persists and if he manages to present himself to the registrar, he may be disqualified because he did not spell out his middle `<?pagebreak number="361" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter031.html_p361}name, or because he abbreviated a word on the application. And if he manages to fill out an application, he is given a test.

The registrar is the sole judge of whether he passes this test. He may be asked to recite the entire Constitution, or explain the most complex provisions of state law.

And even a college degree cannot be used to prove that he can read and write. For the fact is that the only way to pass these barriers is to show a white skin.

Experience has clearly shown that the existing process of law cannot overcome systematic and ingenious discrimination. No law that we now have on the books, and I have helped to put three of them there, can insure the right to vote when local officials are determined to deny it. In such a case, our duty must be clear to all of us.

The Constitution says that no person shall be kept from voting because of his race or his colour. We have all sworn an oath before God to support and to defend that Constitution. We must now act in obedience to that oath.

On Wednesday, I will send to Congress a law designed to eliminate illegal barriers to the right to vote ...

Outside this chamber is the outraged conscience of a nation, the grave concern of many nations and the harsh judgement of history on our acts.

But even if we pass this bill the battle will not be over.

What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life.

Their cause must be our cause too. Because it's not just Negroes but really it's all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.

As a man whose roots go deeply into Southern soil, I know how agonizing racial feelings are. I know how difficult it is to reshape the attitudes and the structure of our society. But a century has passed -- more than one hundred years -- since the Negro was freed.

And he is not fully free tonight.

It was more than one hundred years ago that Abraham Lincoln -- a `<?pagebreak number="362" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter031.html_p362}great President of another party -- signed the Emancipation Proclamation. But emancipation is a proclamation and not a fact.

A century has passed -- more than one hundred years -- since equality was promised, and yet the Negro is not equal.

A century has passed since the day of promise, and the promise is unkept. The time of justice has now come, and I tell you that I believe sincerely that no force can hold it back. It is right in the eyes of man and God that it should come, and when it does, I think that day will brighten the lives of every American.

For Negroes are not the only victims. How many white children have gone uneducated? How many white families have lived in stark poverty? How many white lives have been scarred by fear, because we wasted energy and our substance to maintain the barriers of hatred and terror?

And so I say to all of you here and to all in the nation tonight that those who appeal to you to hold on to the past do so at the cost of denying you your future. This great rich, restless country can offer opportunity and education and hope to all -- all, black and white, all, North and South, sharecropper and city dweller.

These are the enemies: poverty, ignorance, disease. They are our enemies, not our fellow man, not our neighbour. And these enemies too -- poverty, disease and ignorance -- we shall overcome.

> *The speech was seen as the zenith of the first three years of Johnson's presidency. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Bill four months later on 6 August.*
