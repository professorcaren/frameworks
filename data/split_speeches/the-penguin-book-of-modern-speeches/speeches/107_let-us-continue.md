#### 'Let us continue' {#chapter029.html_pen0002685 .EB10SmallHead}

> *According to the historian Theodore White, there was no word less than superb to describe the performance of Lyndon Johnson (1908--73) as he became president of the United States after the assassination of John Kennedy. All accounts of his behaviour through that week of tragedy endowed him with 'superlative grace'. At his inauguration, Kennedy had declared: 'Let us begin.' Now Johnson used the healing words: 'Let us continue' and proceeded to make continuity the watchword of Washington.*
>
> *On the Sunday after the assassination, Johnson detailed some of the best `<?pagebreak number="336" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter029.html_p336}brains of Kennedy's staff -- Theodore Sorensen, McGeorge Bundy and J. K. Galbraith -- to draft his first speech to Congress, adding to the team his old friend Abe Fortas, a Washington lawyer, and Bill Moyers and Horace Busby from his personal staff to add ideas.*
>
> *He laboured on the speech throughout the next two days, changing words and phrases as he sought the right tone. When Bundy and Moyers brought him the finished speech, he pencilled in freshly the words that came from his own heart -- 'For thirty-two years Capitol Hill has been my home' -- and was ready to deliver the address that made his personal policy into national policy.*

Mr Speaker, Mr President, Members of the House, Members of the Senate, my fellow Americans:

All I have I would have given gladly not to be standing here today.

The greatest leader of our time has been struck down by the foulest deed of our time. Today John Fitzgerald Kennedy lives on in the immortal words and works that he left behind. He lives on in the mind and memories of mankind. He lives on in the hearts of his countrymen.

No words are sad enough to express our sense of loss. No words are strong enough to express our determination to continue the forward thrust of America that he began.

The dream of conquering the vastness of space -- the dream of partnership across the Atlantic -- and across the Pacific as well -- the dream of a Peace Corps in less developed nations -- the dream of education for all of our children -- the dream of jobs for all who seek them and need them -- the dream of care for our elderly -- the dream of an all-out attack on mental illness -- and above all, the dream of equal rights for all Americans, whatever their race or colour -- these and other American dreams have been vitalized by his drive and by his dedication.

And now the ideas and the ideals which he so nobly represented must and will be translated into effective action.

Under John Kennedy's leadership, this Nation has demonstrated that it has the courage to seek peace, and it has the fortitude to risk war. We have proved that we are a good and reliable friend to those who seek peace and freedom. We have shown that we can also be a `<?pagebreak number="337" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter029.html_p337}formidable foe to those who reject the path of peace and those who seek to impose upon us or our allies the yoke of tyranny.

This Nation will keep its commitments from South Viet-Nam to West Berlin. We will be unceasing in the search for peace; resourceful in our pursuit of areas of agreement even with those with whom we differ; and generous and loyal to those who join with us in common cause.

In this age when there can be no losers in peace and no victors in war, we must recognize the obligation to match national strength with national restraint. We must be prepared at one and the same time for both the confrontation of power and the limitation of power. We must be ready to defend the national interest and to negotiate the common interest. This is the path that we shall continue to pursue. Those who test our courage will find it strong, and those who seek our friendship will find it honourable. We will demonstrate anew that the strong can be just in the use of strength; and the just can be strong in the defence of justice.

And let all know we will extend no special privilege and impose no persecution. We will carry on the fight against poverty and misery, and disease and ignorance, in other lands and in our own.

We will serve all the Nation, not one section or one sector, or one group, but all Americans. These are the United States -- a united people with a united purpose.

Our American unity does not depend upon unanimity. We have differences; but now, as in the past, we can derive from those differences strength, not weakness, wisdom, not despair. Both as a people and a government, we can unite upon a programme, a programme which is wise and just, enlightened and constructive.

For thirty-two years Capitol Hill has been my home. I have shared many moments of pride with you, pride in the ability of the Congress of the United States to act, to meet any crisis, to distil from our differences strong programmes of national action.

An assassin's bullet has thrust upon me the awesome burden of the Presidency. I am here today to say I need your help; I cannot bear this burden alone. I need the help of all Americans, and all America. This Nation has experienced a profound shock, and in this critical `<?pagebreak number="338" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter029.html_p338}moment, it is our duty, yours and mine, as the Government of the United States, to do away with uncertainty and doubt and delay, and to show that we are capable of decisive action; that from the brutal loss of our leader we will derive not weakness, but strength; that we can and will act and act now.

From this chamber of representative government, let all the world know and none misunderstand that I rededicate this Government to the unswerving support of the United Nations, to the honourable and determined execution of our commitments to our allies, to the maintenance of military strength second to none, to the defence of the strength and the stability of the dollar, to the expansion of our foreign trade, to the reinforcement of our programmes of mutual assistance and cooperation in Asia and Africa, and to our Alliance for Progress in this hemisphere.

On the 20th day of January, in 1961, John F. Kennedy told his countrymen that our national work would not be finished 'in the first thousand days, nor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But,' he said, 'let us begin.'

Today, in this moment of new resolve, I would say to all my fellow Americans, let us continue.

This is our challenge -- not to hesitate, not to pause, not to turn about and linger over this evil moment, but to continue on our course so that we may fulfil the destiny that history has set for us.
