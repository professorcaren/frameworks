> *When President Kennedy went to West Berlin for an eight-hour visit in 1963, his motorcade was cheered every foot of the way. He got his first sight of the Berlin Wall as he approached the Brandenburg Gate. He had been scheduled to gaze over the wall through the gate on to the Unter den Linden, once the main avenue of the German capital, but the five arches of the gate were covered by red banners blocking his view of East Berlin.*
>
> *Kennedy's speech that day, from the city where the Iron Curtain showed the great divide between Communist East and capitalist West at its most cruel in the symbolism of the Berlin Wall, struck a chord that reverberated around the world.*

Two thousand years ago the proudest boast was 'civis Romanus sum'. Today in the world of freedom the proudest boast is 'Ich bin ein Berliner.'

There are many people in the world who really don't understand -- or say they don't -- what is the great issue between the free world and the Communist world. Let them come to Berlin.

There are some who say that Communism is the wave of the future. Let them come to Berlin.

And there are some who say in Europe and elsewhere 'We can work with the Communists.' Let them come to Berlin.

And there are even a few who say that it's true that Communism is an evil system but it permits us to make economic progress. Let them come to Berlin.

Freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect. But we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in, to prevent them from leaving us.

I want to say on behalf of my countrymen who live many miles away on the other side of the Atlantic, who are far distant from you, that they take the greatest pride that they have been able to `<?pagebreak number="324" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter028.html_p324}share with you, even from a distance, the story of the last eighteen years.

I know of no town, no city that has been besieged for eighteen years that still lives with the vitality and the force and the hope and the determination of the city of West Berlin.

While the wall is the most obvious and vivid demonstration of the failures of the Communist system, all the world can see we take no satisfaction in it, for it is, as your Mayor has said, an offence not only against history, but an offence against humanity, separating families, dividing husbands and wives and brothers and sisters and dividing a people who wish to be joined together.

What is true of this city is true of Germany. Real lasting peace in Europe can never be assured as long as one German out of four is denied the elementary right of free men, and that is to make a free choice.

In eighteen years of peace and good faith this generation of Germans has earned the right to be free, including the right to unite their families and their nation in lasting peace with goodwill to all people.

You live in a defended island of freedom, but your life is part of the main. So let me ask you as I close, to lift your eyes beyond the dangers of today to the hopes of tomorrow, beyond the freedom merely of this city of Berlin and all your country of Germany to the advance of freedom everywhere, beyond the wall to the day of peace with justice, beyond yourselves and ourselves to all mankind.

Freedom is indivisible and when one man is enslaved who are free? When all are free, then we can look forward to that day when this city will be joined as one and this country and this great continent of Europe in a peaceful and hopeful globe.

When that day finally comes, as it will, the people of West Berlin can take sober satisfaction in the fact that they were in the front lines for almost two decades.

All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin. And therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words 'Ich bin ein Berliner.'
