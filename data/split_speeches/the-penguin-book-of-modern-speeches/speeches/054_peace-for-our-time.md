#### 'Peace for our time' {#chapter015.html_pen0001280 .EB10SmallHead}

> *If Hitler's declaration that his patience was at an end was the most ominous sentence of the century, Neville Chamberlain's belief that he had won peace from Hitler was the most complacent. After conferring with Hitler, Mussolini and Daladier, Chamberlain (1869--1940), British prime minister since May* 1937*, had signed the Munich Pact and returned to London a hero.*
>
> *He addressed the cheering crowd from a first-floor window at 10 Downing Street.*

My good friends, this is the second time in our history that there has come back from Germany to Downing Street peace with honour. (*After the cheering stopped, Chamberlain continued*.) I believe it is peace for `<?pagebreak number="172" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter015.html_p172}our time. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts. (*To this the crowd responded: 'We thank you. God bless you.' Then a pause until Chamberlain said:*) And now I recommend you to go home and sleep quietly in your beds.
