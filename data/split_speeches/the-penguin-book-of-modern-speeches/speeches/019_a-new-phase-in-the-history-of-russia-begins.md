#### 'A new phase in the history of Russia begins' {#chapter005.html_pen0000503 .EB10SmallHead}

> *After the Russian Revolution of March 1917, Lenin travelled back to Petrograd from Switzerland, passing through Germany in a sealed train provided by the German general staff, who counted on the Bolsheviks spreading disaffection among the Russian soldiers.*
>
> *An honour guard of Kronstadt sailors in striped jerseys and red pompon hats met Lenin at the Finland Station. A brass band played the 'Marseillaise'. Lenin was taken to the imperial waiting-room where he addressed a dense crowd and immediately snubbed any hope that the Bolsheviks would close democratic ranks with the Mensheviks. He appealed directly for civil war and international revolution.*

> `<?pagebreak number="63" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter005.html_p63}Dear comrades, soldiers, sailors and workers! I am happy to greet in your persons the victorious Russian revolution, and greet you as the vanguard of the worldwide proletarian army ... The piratical imperialist war is the beginning of civil war throughout Europe ... The hour is not far distant when the peoples will turn their arms against their own capitalist exploiters ... The worldwide socialist revolution has already dawned ... Germany is seething ... Any day now the whole of European capitalism may crash. The Russian revolution accomplished by you has prepared the way and opened a new epoch. Long live the worldwide socialist revolution!

> *As Lenin left the room, an officer on the platform outside saluted him and a detachment of soldiers with bayonets stood to attention. A great roar of a cheer went up from the revolutionary workers and sailors of Petrograd who had come to greet him. The sailors presented arms and their commander reported to Lenin for duty. They wanted him to speak, it was whispered. Lenin walked a few paces and took off his bowler hat.*

> I don't know yet whether you agree with the Provisional Government. But I know very well that when they give you sweet speeches and make many promises they are deceiving you and the whole Russian people. The people need peace. The people need bread and land. And they give you war, hunger, no food, and the land remains with the landowners. Sailors, comrades, you must fight for the revolution, fight to the end.

> *Lenin remained in Petrograd until 18 July, when the failure of an abortive Soviet* coup d'état *forced him to escape again to Finland. He returned to Petrograd on 23 October and from his headquarters in the Smolny Institute led the rising which captured the government offices. The Bolshevik forces went into action on 25 October. The key points in the city were occupied. Members of the provisional government were prisoners or fugitives. That afternoon, Lenin announced to a meeting of the Petrograd Soviet the triumph of 'the workers' and peasants' revolution'.*

`<?pagebreak number="64" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter005.html_p64}Comrades, the workers' and peasants' revolution, about the necessity of which the Bolsheviks have always spoken, has been accomplished.

What is the significance of this workers' and peasants' revolution? Its significance is, first of all, that we shall have a Soviet government, our own organ of power, in which the bourgeoisie will have no share whatsoever. The oppressed masses will themselves create a power. The old state apparatus will be shattered to its foundations and a new administrative apparatus set up in the form of the Soviet organizations.

From now on, a new phase in the history of Russia begins, and this, the third Russian revolution, should in the end lead to the victory of socialism.

One of our urgent tasks is to put an immediate end to the war. It is clear to everybody that in order to end this war, which is closely bound up with the present capitalist system, capital itself must be fought.

We shall be helped in this by the world working-class movement, which is already beginning to develop in Italy, Britain and Germany.

The proposal we make to international democracy for a just and immediate peace will everywhere awaken an ardent response among the international proletarian masses. All the secret treaties must be immediately published in order to strengthen the confidence of the proletariat.

Within Russia a huge section of the peasantry have said that they have played long enough with the capitalists, and will now march with the workers. A single decree putting an end to landed proprietorship will win us the confidence of the peasants. The peasants will understand that the salvation of the peasantry lies only in an alliance with the workers. We shall institute genuine workers' control over production.

We have now learned to make a concerted effort. The revolution that has just been accomplished is evidence of this. We possess the strength of mass organization, which will overcome everything and lead the proletariat to the world revolution.

We must now set about building a proletarian socialist state in Russia.

`<?pagebreak number="65" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter005.html_p65}Long live the world socialist revolution! (*Stormy applause.*)

> *That evening the second All-Russian Congress of Soviets proclaimed the transfer of all power throughout Russia to Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies. As Lenin stood at the reading-stand, he was greeted by a long-rolling ovation. When it finished, he said simply: 'We shall now proceed to construct the socialist order.' Again there was an overwhelming human roar. The congress adopted decrees on peace and on the land and approved the composition of the Council of People's Commissars -- the first workers' and peasants' government.*
>
> *Yet the Bolsheviks were massively defeated in the elections that followed. When the Constituent Assembly, the dream of Russia's revolutionaries and liberals for nearly a century, met in January 1918, it was dissolved by force.*
>
> *The Bolsheviks seized power and went on, particularly under Lenin's successor Joseph Stalin, to construct one of the worst tyrannies of the twentieth century. 'Lenin and the party, the man and the instrument, were now indissolubly one,' says E. H. Carr. 'The foundations had been laid of the ascendancy in the party of the single leader.'*
