## Reinhard Heydrich Wannsee, 20 January 1942 {#chapter020.html_pen0001650 .EB04MainHead}

#### 'The final solution' {#chapter020.html_pen0001654 .EB10SmallHead}

> *One of the most important events in the history of the twentieth century occurred at a villa on the banks of the Wannsee, a lake near Berlin, on 20 January 1942. It was a conference under the chairmanship of Reinhard Heydrich, head of the* SS *Intelligence Service, at which Hitler's Nazis planned the final solution, the extermination of about eleven million Jews in Europe. Heydrich had been appointed 'Plenipotentiary for the Preparation of the Final Solution of the European Jewish Question*'.

> *This was his address to the senior civil servants*.

We have the means, the methods, the organization, experience and people. And we have the will. This is a historic moment in the struggle against Jewry. The Führer has declared his determination ... to destroy European Jewry. The Führer sees himself ... as exterminating `<?pagebreak number="210" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter020.html_p210}fatal bacteria to save the organism. It is them or us. What has happened so far? Step by step we have forced the Jews out of all levels of German life ...

We have forced them out of the *Lebensraum* of the people partly by transfers to concentration camps, and partly due to Obersturm-bannführer Eichmann's organization by permitting 537,000 Jews to emigrate before the war; and finally ...

We have seen since the beginning of the war the liquidation of hundreds of thousands of Polish, Baltic and Russian Jews. You gentlemen from the Party Chancellery, the Reich Chancellery, the Foreign Office, General Government and Ministry for the East have been kept informed by Gestapo reports of the Action groups' activities ...

The Reichsführer SS has forbidden any further emigration of Jews. The Jews remaining in the Reich and all European Jews in our present and future spheres of influence will be evacuated to the East for the final solution ...

We shall work effectively but silently. Total cooperation will be required in this matter of life or death for the Reich. So that we can all envisage what the Jewish question in the Reich involves (*pointing to a map of Europe*) the red area shows the Reich on the eve of war. This is the Eastern front. Behind in white conquered Eastern territories under Germany's civilian rule. In pink territories subject to the Reich -- in vertical red stripes occupied territories in the rest of Europe. Horizontal red stripes, our Allies or countries under our influence. The dots on the map like fly spots represent the density of the Jewish population. That is our problem the further we advance between Riga and Odessa.

We must deal with the settlements of our Jewish opponents. They've made themselves comfortable there for centuries. In my own home town of Odessa there are more than 70,000 Jewish inhabitants. There were, used to be (*laughter*). To sum up, gentlemen, our Action groups following hard on the heels of our troops have virtually eliminated the Jewish concentrations. We have influenced the old anti-Semitism by certain procedural measures.

Now the rough work has been done we begin the period of finer work. We need to work in harmony with the civil administration. We `<?pagebreak number="211" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter020.html_p211}count on you gentlemen as far as the final solution is concerned. What is to be resolved will be resolved here (*pointing to the East*), at the world's arse, as my men say. War and gunsmoke have made immense achievements possible. It is the Reichsführer SS's will that the Jewish question is settled there in one clean sweep. The total Jews concerned -- 11,000,000.

This breaks down as follows:

In the old Reich -- 130,000

In Austria -- 43,000

In the Protectorate -- 75,000

In the General Government -- 2,500,000

In the Balkans -- 1,600,000

In Occupied France -- 165,000

In Unoccupied France -- 740,000 (Quite a task!)

In the New Europe for which we shall be responsible, in foreign unoccupied countries, like England -- 330,000

In neutral countries like Switzerland -- 18,000 of the Chosen People.

In the final solution we will use the Jews as labour in the East. They will be marched, both sexes segregated, in columns, building roads on the way, breaking rocks, draining marshes. We'll give them every opportunity to find out what work means, on the extensive industrial plants now being constructed by Comrade Pohl of the SS's Economic Office ...

Of course, most of these Jews will succumb to natural wastage: the remainder, the toughest, will have to be processed accordingly. Why? Because it is the survival of the fittest. Otherwise they'd seed a new Jewish resurrection. Look at history!

> *Heydrich was wounded in Prague on 27 May 1942 by two Czechs parachuted in from Britain. He died eight days later. His death was revenged by the massacre at Lidice. Wherever Heydrich went, a trail of blood was always left behind. He was correctly described as a butcher and a hangman*.
