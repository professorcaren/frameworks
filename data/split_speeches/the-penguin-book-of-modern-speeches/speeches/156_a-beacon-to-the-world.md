## Tony Blair Brighton, 30 September 1997 {#chapter043.html_pen0004145 .EB04MainHead}

#### 'A beacon to the world' {#chapter043.html_pen0004149 .EB10SmallHead}

> *Tony Blair became the third youngest prime minister in British history (after Pitt the Younger and Lord Liverpool) when New Labour won a landslide victory over John Major's Conservatives in the 1997 general election. He was the most popular prime minister since opinion polls began.*
>
> *There was an element of triumphalism in his speech to the first party conference `<?pagebreak number="511" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter043.html_p511}held under a Labour government since 1979 but it also demonstrated how far the Labour Party had travelled in the previous eighteen years. There was no mention of socialism or equality or nationalization. Instead Blair emphasized duty over rights, the importance of family life, zero tolerance on crime and a more positive approach to European unity as he appealed for Britain to become a beacon to the world. Even right-wing commentators hailed the speech as a historic statement of intent.*

It has been a very long time waiting for this moment and all I can tell you is that after eighteen long years of Opposition, I am deeply proud -- privileged -- to stand before you as the new Labour Prime Minister of our country.

I believe in Britain. I believe in the British people. One cross on the ballot paper. One nation was reborn.

Today, I want to set an ambitious course for this country: to be nothing less than the model twenty-first-century nation, a beacon to the world. It means drawing deep into the richness of the British character. Creative. Compassionate. Outward-looking. Old British values, but a new British confidence.

We can never be the biggest. We may never again be the mightiest. But we can be the best. The best place to live. The best place to bring up children, the best place to lead a fulfilled life, the best place to grow old.

Fourteen years ago, our party was written off as history. This year we made history. And let our first thanks be to the British people. You kept faith with us. And we will keep faith with you. Thank you to the party organization, the volunteers, the professionals who fashioned the finest political fighting machine our country has ever known.

Ours was not a victory of politicians but of people. The people took their trust, and gave it to us. I want them to say, this week as they watch us here in Brighton, 'We did the right thing.' I want the British people to be as proud of having elected us as we are to serve them. We won because we are new Labour, because we had the courage to change ourselves, and the discipline to take hard decisions, whilst remaining united.

`<?pagebreak number="512" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter043.html_p512}But I want to do more than keep our promises. I sense the British people demand more of us, too. People ask me the highlight of the election. Mine was driving from home to Buckingham Palace, along streets we had driven hundreds of times, past soulless buildings and sullen faces on their way to work. This drive was so different. As we turned into Gower Street, people watching our journey on TV came pouring out of the doorways, waving and shouting and clapping, with an energy and excitement that went beyond anything I imagined would happen.

They were liberated. Theirs were the smiles of tolerant, broadminded, outward-looking, compassionate people and suddenly they learnt that they were in the majority after all. As one woman put it to me: 'We've got our Government back.' And with them I could sense confidence returning to the British people, compassion to the British soul, unity to the British nation, and that all three would give us new-found strength.

You see, the people were yearning for change in their country, at a time when they could see we had had the guts to modernize our party. The two came together.

The result is a quiet revolution now taking place. Led by the real modernizer: not me, the British people. They were the ones who had the guts to do it. And I say the size of our victory puts a special responsibility on us. To be a Government of high ideals and hard choices. Not popular for one time, but remembered for all time. Not just a better Government than the Tories but one of the great, radical, reforming governments of our history.

The British don't fear change. We are one of the great innovative peoples. From the Magna Carta to the first Parliament to the Industrial Revolution to an Empire that covered the world. Most of the great inventions of modern times with Britain stamped on them: the telephone; the television; the computer; penicillin; the hovercraft; radar.

Change is in the blood and bones of the British. We are by our nature and tradition innovators, adventurers, pioneers. As our great poet of renewal and recovery, John Milton, put it, we are 'a nation not slow or dull, but of quick, ingenious and piercing spirit, acute to `<?pagebreak number="513" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter043.html_p513}invent, subtle and sinewy to discourse, not beneath the reach of any point that human capacity can soar to'.

Even today in Britain we lead the world, in design, pharmaceuticals, financial services, telecommunications. We have the world's first language, English. Britain today is an exciting, inspiring place to be. And it can be much more, if we face the challenge of a world around us today that has its finger on the fast-forward button; where every part of the picture of our life is changing, changing constantly.

So today I say to the British people the chains of mediocrity have broken, the tired days are behind us, we are free to excel once more. We are free to build that model twenty-first-century nation, to become that beacon to the world.

Creative. Compassionate. Confident of our place in the world. And you know, when people say, 'Sorry, that's too ambitious. Sorry, it can't be done,' I say: this is not a sorry country, we are not a sorry people. It can be done: if you have the will, the courage and determination to do it ...

It's pretty simple, the type of country I want. It's a country where our children are proud and happy to grow up, feeling good not just about themselves, but about the community around them.

I don't want them living in a country where some of them go to school hungry, unable to learn because their parents can't afford to feed them; where they can see drugs being traded at school gates; where gangs of teenagers hang around street corners, doing nothing but spitting and swearing and abusing passers-by.

I don't want them brought up in a country where the only way pensioners can get long-term care is by selling their home, where people who fought to keep that country free are now faced every winter with the struggle for survival, skimping and saving, cold and alone, waiting for death to take them.

And I will not rest until that country is gone, until all our children live in a Britain where no child goes hungry, the young are employed, and the old are cherished and valued to the end of their days.

But let me spell out some facts. After eighteen years of Tory Government, of cuts and closures, of declining public services, the country was taxed more than under the last Labour Government.

`<?pagebreak number="514" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter043.html_p514}This country, any country today, will not just carry on paying out more in taxes and getting less. Our new society that we want to create will have the same values as it ever did. Fighting poverty and unemployment. Securing justice and opportunity. It should be a compassionate society. It *must* be a compassionate society.

But it is compassion with a hard edge, because a strong society cannot be built in the real world on soft choices. It means fundamental reform of our welfare state, of the deal between citizen and society. It means getting money out of social breakdown and into schools and hospitals where we want to see it.

The new welfare state must encourage work, not dependency ... We want single mothers with school-age children at least to visit a job centre, not just stay at home waiting for the benefit cheque, every week until the children are sixteen.

We cannot be that beacon to the world in the year 2005 with a welfare state built for the very different world of 1945. Our tax system should reward hard work. In the eighties, the Tories took down high marginal tax rates for high earners. It is time we did the same for Britain's working poor.

And we need to bring a change to the way we treat each other as citizens of our society. I tell you: a decent society is not based on rights. It is based on duty. Our duty to each other. To all should be given opportunity, from all responsibility demanded. The duty to show respect and tolerance to others.

I make no apology. I back zero tolerance on crime. I back powers to tackle antisocial neighbours; to make parents responsible for their children; to overhaul the youth justice system so that youngsters stop thinking they can commit a crime, get a caution and carry on being a criminal. At every level of the fight against crime -- today acting on serious organized crime -- this new Labour Government is taking it on. But to those who say it's all a threat to our civil liberties, I say the threat to civil liberties is of women afraid to go out, and pensioners afraid to stay in their own homes because of crime. And when we give opportunities to people, we can demand responsibility.

And we cannot say we want a strong and secure society when we ignore its very foundation: family life. This is not about preaching to `<?pagebreak number="515" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter043.html_p515}individuals about their private lives. It is addressing a huge social problem. Attitudes have changed. The world has changed. But I am a modern man leading a modern country and this is a modern crisis. Nearly 100,000 teenage pregnancies every year. Elderly parents with whom families cannot cope. Children growing up without role models they can respect and learn from. More and deeper poverty. More crime. More truancy. More neglect of educational opportunities. And above all, more unhappiness. That unhappiness we must change ...

My vision for post-Empire Britain is clear. It is to make this country pivotal, a leader in the world. With the US our friend and ally. Within the Commonwealth. In the United Nations. In Nato. To use the superb reputation of our Armed Forces, not just for defence, but as an instrument of influence in a world of collective security and co-operation.

And for Britain to lead in Europe again. Not so that we 'don't get left behind'. That is a weak reason. It is because for four centuries or more we have been a leading power in Europe. And we have at times been absolutely critical to the survival of, not just Europe, but of the whole world. It is our destiny to lead in Europe.

And Europe needs us. For we have a vision of Europe. We want a people's Europe: free trade, industrial strength, high levels of employment and social justice, a democratic Europe. And against that vision is the bureaucrat's Europe: the Europe of thwarting open trade, unnecessary rules and regulations, the Europe of the CAP and the endless committees leading nowhere. But we cannot shape Europe unless we matter in Europe.

I know there will be a hard choice to come over a single currency. And our policy, based as it is on the British national interest, remains unchanged. But in or out, we will be affected by it and must remain able to influence the way that it works ...

So much to do. So much to change. So hard to do it. But the vision is as old as humanity. Modernization is not an end in itself. It is for a purpose. Modernization is not the enemy of justice, but its ally.

Progress and justice are the two rocks upon which the new Britain is raised to the heights. Lose either one and we come crashing down `<?pagebreak number="516" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter043.html_p516}until we are just another average nation, scrabbling around for salvation in the ebbing tide of the twentieth century.

That is why we changed the Labour Party. To make new Britain. It is why we will carry on changing. It is why it was right yesterday to take another historic step on the road to reform of our party so that never again will a Labour Government be torn about by divisions between leadership in Parliament and the party in the country.

And let me tell you this directly. Yes, we are new Labour. Yes, our policies and attitudes have changed. But there are no old Labour or new Labour values. There are Labour values. They are what make us the party of compassion; of social justice; of the struggle against poverty and inequality; of liberty; of basic human solidarity; and the day we cease to be those things is the day we keep the name of the Labour Party but lose the reason for its existence. And ours, you know, is a simple enough vision. But it will require a supreme national effort. It is a task for a whole people, not just a government. Great challenges. But great rewards for all of us if we can rise to them as we can.

And rise as one nation. Held together by our values and by the strength of our character. We are a giving people. In the face of crisis or challenge, we pull together, strengthened by unity. It says nothing about our politics. It speaks volumes about our character.

You remember how your parents, like mine, used to say to you: 'Just do your best.' Well, let us do our best. On May 1, the people entrusted me with the task of leading their country into a new century. That was your challenge to me. And proudly, humbly, I accepted it.

Today, I issue a challenge to you. Help us make Britain that beacon shining throughout the world. Unite behind our mission to modernize our country for all our people. For there is a place for all the people in new Britain, and there is a role for all the people in its creation. Believe in us as much as we believe in you.

Give just as much to our country as all of us intend to give. Give your all. Make this the giving age.

'By the strength of our common endeavour, we achieve more together than we can alone.' On May 1 1997, it wasn't just the Tories who were defeated. Cynicism was defeated. Fear of change was defeated. Fear itself was defeated. Did I not say it would be a battle `<?pagebreak number="517" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter043.html_p517}of hope against fear? On May 1 1997, fear lost. Hope won. The Giving Age began.

Now make the good that is in the heart of each of us serve the good of all of us. Give to our country the gift of our energy, our ideas, our hopes, our talents. Use them to build a country each of whose people will say that 'I care about Britain because I know that Britain cares about me.'

Britain, head and heart, will be unbeatable. That is the Britain I offer you. That is the Britain that together can be ours.
