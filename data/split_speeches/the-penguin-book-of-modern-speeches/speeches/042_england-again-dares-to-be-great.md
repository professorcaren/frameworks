#### 'England again dares to be great' {#chapter011.html_pen0001019 .EB10SmallHead}

> *Oswald Mosley announced the establishment of the British Union of Fascists in October 1932, three months after Hitler's Nazis had won power in the German elections. 'My duty was to awaken the will to live and to live greatly, to dedicate myself to a national renaissance,' he wrote later. A year later the movement became anti-Semitic and Hitlerite rather than fascist. Dressed in black shirts, riding breeches and jackboots the British fascists staged marches through the streets, particularly in the East End of London, distributing propaganda against democracy and socialism and making vicious attacks on the Jews. Their rallies were attended by thousands and often marked by ugly scenes of violence.*
>
> *An audience of 8,000 heard this speech at the Albert Hall in which Mosley set out the vision he saw emanating from the 'first instinct of patriotism'.*

We count it a privilege to live in an age when England demands that great things shall be done, a privilege to be of the generation which `<?pagebreak number="138" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter011.html_p138}learns to say what can we give instead of what can we take. For thus our generation learns there are greater things than slothful ease; greater things than safety; more terrible things than death.

This shall be the epic generation which scales again the heights of time and history to see once more the immortal lights -- the lights of sacrifice and high endeavour summoning through ordeal the soul of humanity to the sublime and the eternal. The alternatives of our age are heroism or oblivion. There are no lesser paths in the history of great nations. Can we, therefore, doubt which path to choose?

Let us tonight at this great meeting give the answer. Hold high the head of England; lift strong the voice of Empire. Let us to Europe and to the world proclaim that the heart of this great people is undaunted and invincible. This flag still challenges the winds of destiny. This flame still burns. This glory shall not die. The soul of Empire is alive, and England again dares to be great.

> *Mosley's fascist movement was a failure. After riots in London in October 1936 the Public Order Act was passed, banning political uniforms and private armies and limiting the right to march in the streets. Mosley was interned during the war and unsuccessfully fought general elections in 1959 and 1966. He lived in Paris and died in 1980.*
