#### 'I warn you' {#chapter037.html_pen0003525 .EB10SmallHead}

> *The Labour Party, led by Michael Foot, was in deep disarray during the British general election of 1983 and its manifesto was described as the longest suicide note in history. One of Foot's most devoted lieutenants was Neil Kinnock* *(1942*--), *a Welsh Labour MP on the left wing of the party and a rising star.*

> `<?pagebreak number="440" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter037.html_p440}*Kinnock showed in this speech, delivered on the eve of the election, that he is a natural orator. It was clear, he declared, that a new Thatcher government would cut spending on health, education, and pensions and increase unemployment, taxes and interest rates. 'I warn you,' he went on ...*

If Margaret Thatcher is re-elected as Prime Minister, *I warn you*

I warn you that you will have pain --

When healing and relief depend upon payment.

I warn you that you will have ignorance --

When talents are untended and wits are wasted, when learning is a privilege and not a right.

I warn you that you will have poverty --

When pensions slip and benefits are whittled away by a Government that won't pay in an economy that can't pay.

I warn you that you will be cold --

When fuel charges are used as a tax system that the rich don't notice and the poor can't afford.

I warn you that you must not expect work --

When many cannot spend, more will not be able to earn. When they don't earn, they don't spend. When they don't spend, work dies.

I warn you not to go into the streets alone after dark or into the streets in large crowds of protest in the light.

I warn you that you will be quiet --

When the curfew of fear and the gibbet of unemployment make you obedient.

I warn you that you will have defence of a sort --

With a risk and at a price that passes all understanding.

`<?pagebreak number="441" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter037.html_p441}I warn you that you will be home-bound --

When fares and transport bills kill leisure and lock you up.

I warn you that you will borrow less --

When credit, loans, mortgages and easy payments are refused to people on your melting income.

If Margaret Thatcher wins, she will be more a Leader than a Prime Minister. That power produces arrogance and when it is toughened by Tebbitry and flattered and fawned upon by spineless sycophants, the boot-licking tabloid Knights of Fleet Street and placemen in the Quangos, the arrogance corrupts absolutely.

If Margaret Thatcher wins --

I warn you not to be ordinary.

I warn you not to be young.

I warn you not to fall ill.

I warn you not to get old.

> *The successful resolution of the Falklands conflict was still vivid in the British memory and Margaret Thatcher won an easy election victory.*

> *Four months later Neil Kinnock was elected leader of the Labour Party.*
