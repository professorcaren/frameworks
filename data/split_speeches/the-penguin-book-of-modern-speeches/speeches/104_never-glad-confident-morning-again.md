> *The Profumo scandal of 1963 arose after John Profumo, Secretary of State for War, was forced to resign after admitting to an affair with Christine Keeler, a call-girl who was simultaneously involved with a Russian naval attaché, about which he had lied to the House of Commons.*
>
> *In a statement to the Commons, Harold Macmillan, the prime minister, emphasized that Profumo was dismissed from the government for lying -- but the general effect of his speech and his conduct throughout the scandal was to show Macmillan as naïve and out of touch.*
>
> *Nigel Birch, who had resigned from Macmillan's government in 1958 in protest at increases in government spending, was one of the most accomplished speakers in the Commons. He was pithy, with a coruscating wit, and his interventions often turned a parliamentary debate into an occasion.*
>
> *The most notable was when he attacked Macmillan in the Profumo debate and ended his speech with a quotation from Robert Browning, as deadly a use of quotation as Leo Amery's dismissal of Neville Chamberlain.*

We know a deal more now about Profumo than we did at the time of the statement, but we have all known him pretty well for a number of years in this House. I must say that he never struck me as a man at all like a cloistered monk; and Miss Keeler was a professional prostitute ... Here one had an active, busy man and a professional prostitute. On his own admission, Profumo had a number of meetings with her, and, if we are to judge by the published statements, she is not a woman who would be intellectually stimulating. Is it really credible that the association had no sexual content? There seems to me to be a certain basic improbability about the proposition that their relationship was purely platonic. What are whores about? Yet Profumo's word was accepted. It was accepted from a colleague. Would that word have been accepted if Profumo had not been a colleague or `<?pagebreak number="326" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter029.html_p326}even if he had been a political opponent? Everyone must, I think, make his own judgement about that.

We were told that special consideration ought to have been given to Profumo because he was a colleague. It is certainly true that a Prime Minister owes to his subordinates all the help, comfort and protection that he can give them. But surely that help, that comfort and that protection must stop short of condoning a lie in a personal statement to this House.

Then we are told that special weight ought to have been given to Profumo's words because he was a Privy Councillor and a Secretary of State. I am a Privy Councillor and I have been a Secretary of State, but when I sustained the burden of both offices I did not feel that any sea change had taken place in my personality. I remained what I was, what I had always been and what I am today; and I do not believe it reasonable to suppose that any sea change took place in Mr Profumo's personality.

He was not a man who was ever likely to tell the absolute truth in a tight corner, and at the time the statement was made he was in a very tight corner indeed. There are people -- and it is to the credit of our poor, suffering humanity that it is so -- who will tell the whole truth about themselves whatever the consequences may be. Of such are saints and martyrs, but most of us are not like that. Most people in a tight corner either prevaricate -- or, as in this case, they lie.

This lie was accepted. I have meditated very deeply on this, and though I have given some rather tough reasons for not accepting that Profumo's statement was credible, I have after deep consideration come to the conclusion that my Right Hon. Friend did absolutely genuinely believe it. I will give my reasons now for taking that view, and these reasons concern the competence and the good sense with which the affair was handled.

Profumo on his own admission had been guilty of a very considerable indiscretion, for a Minister at any rate. He was not a particularly successful Minister. He had no great place in this House or in the country. I cannot really see that the Prime Minister was under any obligation whatever to retain his services, nor do I think that getting rid of Mr Profumo would, in fact, have made the political situation `<?pagebreak number="327" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter029.html_p327}any worse than it then was. On the other hand, to retain him entailed a colossal risk and a colossal gamble. The difficulties and dangers were obvious enough. The Press were in full cry. They were in possession of letters. They were hardly likely to have bought letters unless they had something of interest in them. Miss Keeler was pretty certain to turn up again, and if she did, editors were sure to make use of her literary talent. The dangers were enormous, and yet this colossal gamble was taken, and in this gamble, as it seems to me, the possible gain was negligible and the possible loss devastating.

The conclusion that I draw from that is that the course adopted by my Right Hon. Friend the Prime Minister could have been adopted only by someone who genuinely and completely believed the statements of Profumo, and therefore, I absolutely acquit my Right Hon. Friend of any sort of dishonour. On the other hand, on the question of competence and good sense I cannot think that the verdict can be favourable.

What is to happen now? I cannot myself see at all that we can go on acting as if nothing had happened. We cannot just have business as usual. I myself feel that the time will come very soon when my Right Hon. Friend ought to make way for a much younger colleague. I feel that that ought to happen. I certainly will not quote at him the savage words of Cromwell, but perhaps some of the words of Browning might be appropriate in his poem on 'The Lost Leader', in which he wrote:

> ... let him never come back to us!
>
> There would be doubt, hesitation and pain.
>
> Forced praise on our part -- the glimmer of twilight,
>
> Never glad confident morning again!

'Never glad confident morning again!' -- so I hope that the change will not be too long delayed.

Ahead of us we have a Division. We have the statement of my Right Hon. and noble Friend Lord Hailsham, in a personal assurance on television, that a Whip is not a summons to vote but a summons to attend. I call the Whips to witness that I at any rate have attended.

> `<?pagebreak number="328" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter029.html_p328}*The speech electrified the Commons. The publicity it received and its effect on Birch's fellow Tories weakened Macmillan's hold over the Tory Party. Macmillan retired four months later. Birch was created a life peer and became Lord Rhyl in 1970.*
