#### 'My head erect' {#chapter015.html_pen0001292 .EB10SmallHead}

> *Duff Cooper (1890--1954) entered parliament as a Conservative in 1924 and was Secretary for War from 1935 to 1937, when he became First Lord of the Admiralty. When the House of Commons met after the Munich agreement Conservatives rose and cheered when Chamberlain entered the chamber. He also had the tacit support of the Labour benches.*
>
> *In his memoir* Old Men Forget*,* *Cooper recalled that members were anxious to hear Chamberlain: 'As I had to speak first, I had an unsympathetic and impatient audience.'*
>
> *As he explained the reasons for his dramatic resignation -- Sir Anthony Eden, Chamberlain's Foreign Secretary, had resigned earlier over the Italian invasion of Abyssinia -- he said Britain should have been fighting to prevent one great power from dominating the continent of Europe by 'brute force', in defiance of treaty obligations, of the laws of nations and the decrees of morality.*

When Herr Hitler broke the Treaty of Versailles he undertook to keep the Treaty of Locarno, and when he broke the Treaty of Locarno, he undertook not to interfere further or to have any territorial aims in Europe. When he entered Austria by force he authorized his henchmen to give an authoritative assurance that he would not interfere with Czechoslovakia. That was less than six months ago. Still the Prime Minister believes that he can rely upon 'the good faith of Hitler' ...

The Prime Minister may be right. I can assure you, Mr Speaker, with the deepest sincerity, that I hope and pray that he is right, but I cannot believe what he believes. I wish I could. Therefore, I can be `<?pagebreak number="173" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter015.html_p173}of no assistance to him in his Government. I should only be a hindrance, and it is much better that I should go. I remember when we were discussing the Godesberg ultimatum that I said that if I were a party to persuading, or even to suggesting to, the Czechoslovak Government that they should accept that ultimatum, I should never be able to hold up my head again. I have forfeited a great deal. I have given up an office that I loved, work in which I was deeply interested and a staff of which any man might be proud. I have given up association in that work with my colleagues with whom I have maintained for many years the most harmonious relations, not only as colleagues but as friends. I have given up the privilege of serving as lieutenant to a leader whom I still regard with the deepest admiration and affection. I have ruined, perhaps, my political career. But that is a little matter; I have retained something which is to me of greater value -- I can still walk about the world with my head erect.

> *Chamberlain made no attempt to answer Cooper, who had immediate notes of congratulation from Winston Churchill and Harold Macmillan. 'Your speech ... was admirable in form, massive in argument and shone with courage and public spirit,' said Churchill. Cooper, who became the first Viscount Norwich, was Churchill's Minister of Information (1940--42) and ambassador to France (1944--7)*.
