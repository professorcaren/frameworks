#### 'The oppression is growing' {#chapter015.html_pen0001226 .EB10SmallHead}

> *As Martin Niemöller (1892--1984) celebrated Holy Communion on Friday, 25 June 1937, he was incensed to discover that three members of the Gestapo were present. He had also heard that Hans Asmussen, theological adviser to the council of the German church, had gone into hiding from the Nazis.*

> *On the following Sunday, the subject of Niemöller's sermon was Rabbi Gamaliel who, according to Acts 5, had persuaded the Jewish Sanhedrin to show tolerance to the teaching of St Peter and his fellow Christians. The result was `<?pagebreak number="166" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter015.html_p166}that the apostles were released from custody. Neutrality was impossible, Niemöller preached. Persecution had begun.*

[(The Lord shall yet comfort Zion) Acts 5: 33--42:]{.center}

Jesus Christ says: 'Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you for My sake.' And faith hears that, and faith clings to that promise, and faith is happy and comforted, as Jesus bade it: 'Rejoice and be exceeding glad!'

But, brothers and sisters, can this *really* be so? Can we be happy and comforted in our faith? We see today that this matter of a happy and comforted faith is no child's play, that it is not enough to be able to quote passages from the Bible; that we do not go far with a little inspired protestation and our usual normal measure of inextinguishable optimism, and that we have reached the point where we cannot resist alone, without help.

The oppression is growing, and anyone who has had to submit to the Tempter's machine-gun fire during this last week thinks differently from what he did even three weeks ago. I have in mind how on Wednesday the Secret Police forced their way into the locked church at Friedrichwerder and in the vestry arrested eight members of the Reich Council of Brethren who were holding a meeting there, and took them away. I have in mind how yesterday at Saarbrücken six women and a male member of the congregation were taken into custody because they were distributing an election leaflet of the Confessional Church, at the request of the Council of Brethren. I say to you: anyone who knows these things and who has actually had to suffer these things, is not far from uttering the Prophet's words -- indeed such a one would fain say with the Prophet: 'It is enough -- no, it is too much! -- now, O Lord, take away my life!'

And anyone who has the experience I had the night before last at an evening Communion service and sees beside him nothing less than three young members of the Secret Police who have come in their official capacity to spy upon the community of Jesus Christ in their praying, singing and preaching -- three young men who were also assuredly baptized once upon a time in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and who also assuredly vowed loyalty to their Saviour at `<?pagebreak number="167" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter015.html_p167}the confirmation altar, and whose office and duty it now is to set traps for the community of Jesus Christ -- anyone who sees that cannot escape so easily from the shame of the Church; he cannot pass the matter off with a pious phrase and an inspired protest: such a sight may cost him a sleepless and most certainly a restless night, and he may even cry from the depths of his despair: 'Lord, have mercy upon me!'

> *Niemöller never again preached in Dahlem church until after the death of Adolf Hitler. On 1 July, he was arrested by the secret police. A year later he was taken to Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp, and then to Dachau. He spent four years in solitary confinement before being liberated by the Allies in 1945.*
