> *As Secretary of State for the Environment in Margaret Thatcher's first government, Michael Heseltine* *(1933*--*),* *one of the outstanding orators of the contemporary British Tory Party, was charged with studying the problems of Merseyside, the region around the declining seaport of Liverpool, after the summer riots of 1980. Heseltine always sat uncomfortably in Thatcher governments: he still believed in what had become the unfashionable view that state intervention could help to reverse decades of decline in Britain's inner cities.*
>
> *Speaking to the Conservative conference a year later, he made an impassioned call that Conservative politics must deny rioters and wreckers any fertile ground to sow the seeds of discontent. He appealed to the one-nation doctrines of Disraeli and Iain Macleod that had kept the Tory Party in the forefront of British politics. Self-help* *(the Thatcherite creed)* *had a limited meaning in an inner-city community where forty per cent of young kids were without work, he declared.*
>
> *Then he moved into the main thrust of his speech.*

I come from South Wales. This nation is still suffering from the legacies, from the folklore and from the memories of those bitter inter-war years. They have fuelled a venom in the Labour Party and in the trade unions that has set back our industrial society almost beyond redemption.

This is the great challenge for our party, for we alone believe in politics as a process of healing, of drawing together and of building together on common strengths. There is not a person here who has not cheered to the echo the great names, the great phrases that secured for our party a well-nigh incredible record of governing Britain over so long a period.

`<?pagebreak number="433" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter036.html_p433}It required great courage when Disraeli first talked of one nation. It did not represent a conventional view of the time. It flew in the teeth of much that was contemporary experience. But he led the Tory Party through the great traumas of his day because he, in advance of his time, had the vision to lead in his time. Today we cheer the memory of that man. When I joined this party Iain Macleod was a deeply controversial politician, fighting against bitter criticism to keep us close to those same traditions of compassion and tolerance. Those traditions are not ours to squander or abuse. For a brief time they are entrusted to us to make relevant in today's world. They are the traditions that have kept our party in the forefront of British politics in the centre of power.

In our generation we must show the same courage and vision as the leaders whose memories we so frequently applaud. What talk of equality of opportunity? What do those words actually mean in the inner cities today? What do they mean to the black communities? We now have large immigrant communities in British cities. Let this party's position be absolutely clear. They are British. They live here. They vote here. However tight the immigration legislation -- and in everyone's interests it should be tight -- there will be a large black community in this country tomorrow, just as there is today. There are no schemes of significant repatriation that have any moral, social or political credibility.

I will and I do condemn the handful of blacks who rioted. But I condemn just as strongly the whites who rioted alongside them. I totally support the police in their brave and unenviable task of restoring stability in our society.

But the rioters were a tiny section of the black and white populations, the overwhelming majority of whom deplore the riots as vehemently as we do. But the fact remains that of those black communities, who stand for the same values that I have described, far too many -- our people -- know that the education they obtain, the jobs they are offered and the careers that are opened to them do not match up to the finest traditions upon which we pride ourselves.

There is a challenge here in the conditions that we took on from the Labour Party -- because it totally failed to match the scale of the challenge to be found in the inner cities ...

`<?pagebreak number="434" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter036.html_p434}Few of us can remember such testing times for this nation ... we are reaping the whirlwind of all our yesterdays. Decade after decade we have denied our industry the climate for sufficient innovation and investment. Too often we have slaughtered the capital programmes to pay for the over-burgeoning consumption of the public sector. We have extracted as wages today what we should have left as investment for tomorrow. We have, too often, squandered our inheritance, and our inner cities are just a signpost of a journey of despair.

There will be no recovery without more resources. Preferably those resources will be in the form of investment from the private sector or from the better use of existing public programmes. But if the case can be made it may also be from extra public expenditure. From wherever it comes it will require an effort of will by a community of people for a common purpose.

You will say to me, 'What of the wreckers? What of those who will not work, those who strike without cause, those who thump the elderly, smash in the windows and thrive on a life of crime?' Every generation has its wreckers. There have been riots in other times, but our faith has always told us that one cannot sow the seeds of discontent on a stable society. They can flourish only if they find fertile ground. Our politics and policies must deny that fertile ground. Yes, of course, our political opponents will fight us -- as soon as they stop fighting each other. But we have the mettle for that fight.

> *Heseltine won a standing ovation. He resigned from Margaret Thatcher's government in 1986 and challenged her for the leadership of the Tory Party in 1990. On the first ballot he won more votes than Mrs Thatcher and precipitated her downfall, but lost to John Major, whose Cabinet he subsequently joined.*
