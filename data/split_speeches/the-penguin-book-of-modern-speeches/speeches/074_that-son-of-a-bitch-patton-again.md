## General George Patton England and France, 1943--4 {#chapter021.html_pen0001780 .EB04MainHead}

#### 'That son of a bitch Patton again' {#chapter021.html_pen0001784 .EB10SmallHead}

> *'Old Blood and Guts' was the nickname given to General George Patton (1885--1945) by his troops during the Second World War as a testimony to his reputation for recklessness and hot-headed daring.*
>
> *That daring was shown at its most flamboyant in 1944 when his Third Army advanced across France in a sweep through Brittany, round Paris, up the Marne and the Moselle, across the Rhine and eventually into Czechoslovakia in April 1945.*
>
> *As they went into battle, Patton, puffing his cigar, was given to making short, sharp, morale-boosting addresses at his staff conferences and to his men.*
>
> `<?pagebreak number="223" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter021.html_p223}*The three published here were given to his troops in England and Normandy. The third was his welcome to the 761st 'Black Panther' Tank Battalion. They show that you don't need to be long-winded to be eloquent or to allow your audience to get the message, and raised profanity to a fine art.*

I am not supposed to be commanding this Army -- I am not even supposed to be in England. Let the first bastards to find out be the goddam Germans. Some day I want them to rise on their hind legs and howl: 'Jesus Christ, it's that goddam Third Army and that son of a bitch Patton again' ... There's one great thing that you men can say when it's all over and you're home once more. You can thank God that twenty years from now when you're sitting by the fireside with your grandson on your knee, and he asks you what you did in the war, you won't have to shift him to the other knee, cough and say, 'I shovelled crap in Louisiana.'

Now, gentlemen, doubtless from time to time there will be some complaints that we are pushing people too hard. I don't give a good goddam about such complaints. I believe in the old and sound rule that an ounce of sweat is worth a gallon of blood. The harder we push, the more Germans we'll kill, and gentlemen, the more Germans we kill, the fewer of our men will be killed. Pushing means fewer casualties. I want you to remember that.

There's another thing I want you to remember. Forget this goddam business of worrying about our flanks. We must guard our flanks, but not to the extent that we don't do anything else. Some goddammed fool once said that flanks must be secured and since then sons of bitches all over the world have been going crazy guarding their flanks. We don't want any of that in the Third Army. Flanks are something for the enemy to worry about, not us.

Also, I don't want to get any messages saying, 'I'm holding my position.' We're not holding anything! Let the Hun do that. We are advancing constantly and are not interested in holding anything, except the enemy. We're going to hold on to him and kick the hell out of him all the time.

Our basic plan of operation is to advance and to keep on advancing `<?pagebreak number="224" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter021.html_p224}regardless of whether we have to go over, under, or through the enemy. We have one motto, *'L'audace, l'audace, toujours l'audace!'* Remember that, gentlemen. From here on out, until we win or die in the attempt, we will always be audacious.

Men, you are the first Negro tankers ever to fight in the American army. I would never have asked for you if you were not good. I have nothing but the best in my army. I don't care what colour you are as long as you go up there and kill those Kraut sons of bitches. Everyone has their eyes on you and are expecting great things from you. Most of all, your race is looking forward to your success. Don't let them down, and, damn you, don't let me down!

If you want me you can always find me in the lead tank.

> *Patton was killed in a road accident while commanding the US Fifth Army in occupied Germany in December 1945.*
