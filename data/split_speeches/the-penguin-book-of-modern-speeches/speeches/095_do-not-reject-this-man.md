#### 'Do not reject this man' {#chapter025.html_pen0002305 .EB10SmallHead}

> *There were five strong candidates for the Democratic nomination for the presidential election in 1960: Adlai Stevenson, Stuart Symington, Hubert Humphrey, Lyndon Baines Johnson and John F. Kennedy.*
>
> `<?pagebreak number="292" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter025.html_p292}*Stevenson had lost the two previous elections to Eisenhower but was still keen for the nomination that was to be denied to him when the convention opted for Kennedy. Among those who were thinking uneasily of deserting Stevenson for Kennedy, there were many who nevertheless thought Stevenson alone had the intellectual stature and integrity required by the next American president -- and this address by Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota, an eloquent and moving tribute to Stevenson's distinguished career in American politics, stood out from the other nomination speeches for its dramatic boldness.*

These times, men say, are out of joint. They say these are the worst of times without being the best of times -- this may be true. But I say to you these external signs, these practical problems which face us, are nothing compared to the problems of the mind and of the spirit which face the United States and the free world today.

If the mind is clouded and if the will is confused and uncertain, there can be no sound decision and no sound action.

There's demagoguery abroad in the land at all times, and demagoguery, I say to you, takes many forms. There's that which says 'here is wealth, and here is material comfort'. We suffer a little from that in the United States.

There's demagoguery which promises people power, which is used for improper purposes and ends. And we have seen in this century and in this generation what happens when power is abused.

I say to you there's a subtle kind of demagoguery which erodes the spirit. And this is the demagoguery which has affected this United States in the last eight years.

What are we told? What have we been told? We've been told that we can be strong without sacrifice. This is what we've been told. We've been told that we can be good without any kind of discipline if we just say we're humble and sincere -- this is the nature of goodness. We've been told that we can be wise without reflection. We can be wise without study, we've been told. I say this is the erosion of the spirit which has taken place in this United States in the last eight years. And I say to you that the time has come to raise again the cry of the ancient prophet. What did he say? He said the prophets `<?pagebreak number="293" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter025.html_p293}prophesy falsely and the high priests, he said, ruled by their word, and my people love to have it so. But what will be the end?

I say to you the political prophets have prophesied falsely in these eight years. And the high priests of government have ruled by that false prophecy. And the people seemed to have loved it so.

But there was one man -- there was one man who did not prophesy falsely, let me remind you. There was one man who said: Let's talk sense to the American people.

What did the scoffers say? The scoffers said: Nonsense. They said: Catastrophic nonsense. But we know it was the essential and the basic and the fundamental truth that he spoke to us.

There was a man who talked sense to the American people. There was one man who said: This is a time for self-examination. This is a time for us to take stock, he said. This is a time to decide where we are and where we're going.

This, he said, is a time for virtue. But what virtues did he say we needed? Oh yes, he said we need the heroic virtues -- we always do. We need fortitude; we need courage; we need justice. Everyone cheers when you speak out for those virtues.

But what did he say in addition to that? He said we need the unheroic virtues in America. We need the virtue, he said, of patience. There were those who said we've had too much of patience.

We need, he said, the virtue of tolerance. We need the virtue of forbearance. We need the virtues of patience and understanding.

This was what the prophet said. This is what he said to the American people. I ask you, did he prophesy falsely? Did he prophesy falsely?

He said this is a time for greatness. This is a time for greatness for America. He did not say he possessed it. He did not even say he was destined for it. He did say that the heritage of America is one of greatness.

And he described the heritage to us. And he said the promise of America is a promise of greatness. And he said, this promise we must fulfill.

This was his call to greatness. This was the call to greatness that was issued in 1952.

`<?pagebreak number="294" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter025.html_p294}He did not seek power for himself in 1952. He did not seek power in 1956.

He does not seek it for himself today.

This man knows -- this man knows, as all of us do from history, that power often comes to those who seek it. But history does not prove that power is always well used by those who seek it.

On the contrary, the whole history of democratic politics is to this end, that power is best exercised by those who are sought out by the people, by those to whom power is given by a free people.

And so I say to you Democrats here assembled: Do not turn away from this man. Do not reject this man. He has fought gallantly. He has fought courageously. He has fought honourably. In 1952 in the great battle. In 1956 he fought bravely. And between those years and since, he has stood off the guerrilla attacks of his enemies and the sniping attacks of those who should have been his friends. Do not reject this man who has made us all proud to be called Democrats. Do not reject this man who, his enemies said, spoke above the heads of the people, but they said it only because they didn't want the people to listen. He spoke to the people. He moved their minds and stirred their hearts, and this was what was objected to. Do not leave this prophet without honour in his own party. Do not reject this man.

I submit to you a man who is not the favourite son of any one state. I submit to you the man who is the favourite son of fifty states.

And not only of fifty states but the favourite son of every country in the world in which he is known -- the favourite son in every country in which he is unknown but in which some spark even though unexpressed of desire for liberty and freedom still lives.

This favourite son I submit to you: Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois.

> *Stevenson became ambassador to the United Nations in the Kennedy administration. McCarthy challenged President Johnson in 1968 and got forty per cent of the vote in the New Hampshire primary -- which caused Robert Kennedy to declare and persuaded Johnson to stand down. After the assassination of Kennedy, Hubert Humphrey won the nomination.*
