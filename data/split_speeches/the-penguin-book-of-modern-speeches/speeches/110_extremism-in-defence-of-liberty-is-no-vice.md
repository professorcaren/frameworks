> *By the summer of 1964, Barry Goldwater (1909--98), the leading Conservative political spokesman in the United States during the Kennedy administration, had arrived centre stage in American history at a time when intellectual vitality seemed to have run out of the generations-old liberal orthodoxy that had dominated American politics since Roosevelt.*
>
> *At the Cow Palace, Richard Nixon was about to nominate him as Republican candidate against Lyndon Johnson in the presidential election. His speechwriters had worked on his speech for more than two weeks. Goldwater had gone through it five times. No word was unmeasured. The speech was to proclaim a new morality, an uncompromising challenge to the course American politics had followed for the past thirty years within his own party as well as the Democrats.*
>
> *After being portrayed as crazy, stupid and bloodthirsty, Goldwater was an embittered man who decided to go it alone and offer no compromise. The speech signalled the tenor of his campaign which became notorious for his advocacy of increased opposition to world Communism and hostility to the power of federal government. The last two lines were underlined in his text.*

The Good Lord raised this mighty Republican Republic to be a home for the brave and to flourish as the land of the free -- not to stagnate in the swampland of collectivism, not to cringe before the bully of Communism.

Now my fellow Americans, the tide has been running against freedom. Our people have followed false prophets. We must, and we shall, return to proven ways -- not because they are old, but because they are true.

We must, and we shall, set the tide running again in the cause of freedom. And this party, with its every action, every word, every breath and every heartbeat, has but a single resolve, and that is freedom.

Freedom made orderly for this nation by our constitutional `<?pagebreak number="349" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter030.html_p349}government. Freedom under a government limited by laws of nature and of nature's God. Freedom balanced so that order lacking liberty will not become the slavery of the prison cell; balanced so that liberty lacking order will not become the licence of the mob and of the jungle.

Now, we Americans understand freedom. We have earned it: we have lived for it, and we have died for it. This nation and its people are freedom's models in a searching world. We can be freedom's missionaries in a doubting world ...

Those who seek to live your lives for you, to take your liberty in return for relieving you of yours; those who elevate the state and downgrade the citizen, must see ultimately a world in which earthly power can be substituted for Divine Will. And this nation was founded upon the rejection of that notion and upon the acceptance of God as the author of freedom.

Now those who seek absolute power, even though they seek it to do what they regard as good, are simply demanding the right to enforce their own version of heaven on earth, and let me remind you they are the very ones who always create the most hellish tyranny.

Absolute power does corrupt, and those who seek it must be suspect and must be opposed. Their mistaken course stems from false notions, ladies and gentlemen, of equality. Equality, rightly understood as our founding fathers understood it, leads to liberty and to the emancipation of creative differences; wrongly understood, as it has been so tragically in our time, it leads first to conformity and then to despotism.

Fellow Republicans, it is the cause of Republicanism to resist concentrations of power, private or public, which enforce such conformity and inflict such despotism.

It is the cause of Republicanism to insure that power remains in the hands of the people -- and, so help us God, that is exactly what a Republican President will do with the help of a Republican Congress.

It is further the cause of Republicanism to restore a clear understanding of the tyranny of man over man in the world at large. It is our cause to dispel the foggy thinking which avoids hard decisions in `<?pagebreak number="350" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter030.html_p350}the delusion that a world of conflict will somehow resolve itself into a world of harmony, if we just don't rock the boat or irritate the forces of aggression -- and this is hogwash.

It is, further, the cause of Republicanism to remind ourselves, and the world, that only the strong can remain free: that only the strong can keep the peace.

Today -- today in our beloved country -- we have an Administration which seems eager to deal with Communism in every coin known -- from gold to wheat; from consulates to confidence, and even human freedom itself.

Now the Republican cause demands that we brand Communism as the principal disturber of peace in the world. Indeed, we should brand it as the only significant disturber of the peace ...

And I want to make this abundantly clear -- I don't intend to let peace or freedom be torn from our grasp, because of lack of strength, or lack of will -- and that I promise you Americans.

I can see a day when all the Americas -- North and South -- will be linked in a mighty system -- a system in which the errors and misunderstandings of the past will be submerged one by one in a rising tide of prosperity and interdependence ...

Balance, diversity, creative difference -- these are the elements of the Republican equation. Republicans agree, Republicans agree heartily, to disagree on many, many of their applications. But we have never disagreed on the basic fundamental issues of why you and I are Republicans.

This is a party -- this Republican party is a party -- for free men. Not for blunt followers and not for conformists.

Back in 1858 Abraham Lincoln said this of the Republican party, and I quote him because he probably could have said it during the last week or so: it was so composed of strained, discordant, and even hostile elements ...

Yet all of these elements agreed on one paramount objective: to arrest the programme of slavery, and place it in the course of its ultimate extinction.

Anyone who joins us in all sincerity we welcome. Those, those who do not care for our cause, we don't expect to enter our ranks in `<?pagebreak number="351" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter030.html_p351}any case. And let our Republicanism so focused and so dedicated not be made fuzzy and futile by unthinking and stupid labels.

I would remind you that extremism in the defence of liberty is no vice!

And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue!

> *Goldwater's speech ended not only the Eisenhower era in American politics but also the reign of pragmatism in the Republican party. He won only five states in the election which Johnson won with sixty-one per cent of the popular vote, the biggest majority ever achieved by an American president at that time. Goldwater returned to the Senate in 1969 and was later influential in persuading Richard Nixon to step down from the presidency after the Watergate scandal in 1974.*
