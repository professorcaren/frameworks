#### 'I am never be guilty, never' {#chapter006.html_pen0000770 .EB10SmallHead}

> *The United States in 1920 was suffering a violent 'Red scare' and organized labour was protesting at the importation of cheap labour from overseas. On 15 April 1920, the paymaster and the guard of a shoe factory at Milford, Massachusetts, were shot dead and robbed. Nicola Sacco (1891--1927) and Bartolomeo Vanzetti (1888--1927), two Italian immigrants who had become anarchists and also dodged the draft, were arrested and charged with the murders.*
>
> *The trial was held in Dedham and they were found guilty. Associates of Sacco and Vanzetti alerted the left throughout the world to what seemed a perversion of justice, especially because of the prejudice of the judge who described them as 'anarchist bastards'. After the men had been in prison for seven years, they were finally told they were to be executed. Their last speeches to Judge Webster Thayer were movingly dignified, perhaps because their English was so imperfect.*

\[*Sacco*:\] I am not an orator. It is not very familiar with me the English language, and, as I know, as my friend has told me, my comrade Vanzetti will speak more long, so I thought to give him the chance.

I never know, never heard, even read in history anything so cruel as this court. After seven years prosecuting they still consider us guilty. And these gentle people here are arrayed with us in this court today.

I know the sentence will be between two class, the oppressed class and the rich class, and there will be always collision between one and the other. We fraternize the people with the books, with the literature. You persecute the people, tyrannize over them, and kill them. We try the education of people always. You try to put a path between us and some other nationality that hates each other. That is why I am here today on this bench, for having been the oppressed class. Well, you are the oppressor.

You know it, Judge Thayer -- you know all my life, you know why I `<?pagebreak number="102" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter006.html_p102}have been here, and after seven years that you have been persecuting me and my poor wife, and you still today abuse us to death. I would like to tell you my life, but what is the use? You know all about what I say before, and my friend -- that is, my comrade -- will be talking, because he is more familiar with the language, and I will give him a chance. My comrade, the man kind, the kind man to all the children, you sentence him two times, in the Bridgewater case and the Dedham case, connected with me, and you know he is innocent. You forget all the population that has been with us for seven years, to sympathize and give us all their energy and all their kindness. You do not care for them. Among that peoples and the comrades and the working class there is a big legion of intellectual people which have been with us for seven years, but to not commit the iniquitous sentence, but still the court goes ahead. And I think I thank you all, you peoples, my comrades who have been with me for seven years, with the Sacco--Vanzetti case, and I will give my friend a chance.

I forget one thing which my comrade remember me. As I said before, Judge Thayer know all my life, and he know that I am never be guilty, never -- not yesterday nor today nor for ever.

\[*Vanzetti*:\] What I say is that I am innocent, not only of the Braintree crime, but also of the Bridgewater crime. That I am not only innocent of these two crimes, but in all my life I have never stole and I have never killed and I have never spilled blood. That is what I want to say. And it is not all. Not only am I innocent of these two crimes, not only in all my life I have never stole, never killed, never spilled blood, but I have struggled all my life, since I began to reason, to eliminate crime from the earth.

Everybody that knows these two arms knows very well that I did not need to go in between the streets and kill a man to make the money. I can live with my two arms, and live well. But besides that, I can live even without work with my arm for other people. I have had plenty of chance to live independently and to live what the world conceives to be a higher life than not to gain our bread with the sweat of our brow ...

`<?pagebreak number="103" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter006.html_p103}What I want to say is this: Everybody ought to understand that the first of the defence has been terrible. My first lawyer did not stick to defend us. He had made no work to collect witnesses and evidence in our favour. The record in the Plymouth court is a pity. I am told that they are almost gone -- half lost. So the defence had a tremendous work to do in order to collect some evidence, to collect some testimony to offset and to learn what the testimony of the state has done. And in this consideration it take double time of the state without delay, double time that they delay the case it would have been reasonable, whereas it took less than the state.

Well, I have already say that I am not guilty of these two crimes, but I never commit a crime in my life -- I have never steal and I have never kill and I have never spilled blood, and I have fought against the crime, and I have fought and I have sacrificed myself even to eliminate the crimes that the law and the church legitimate and sanctify.

That is what I say: I would not wish to a dog or a snake, to the most low and misfortunate creature of the earth -- I would not wish to any of them what I have had to suffer for things that I am not guilty of. But my conviction is that I have suffered for things that I am guilty of. I am suffering because I am a radical, and indeed I am a radical; I have suffered because I was an Italian, and indeed I am an Italian; I have suffered more for my family and for my beloved than for myself; but I am so convinced to be right that if you would execute me two times, and if I could be reborn two other times, I would live again to do what I have done already.

> *Sacco and Vanzetti were electrocuted on* 23 *August and their execution started riots in London, Paris and Germany. Their case provoked the first serious rebellion against the conservatism of the Republican ascendancy.*
