## Lyndon B. Johnson Washington, DC, 31 March 1968 {#chapter033.html_pen0003062 .EB04MainHead}

#### 'I shall not seek nor will I accept nomination as your president' {#chapter033.html_pen0003066 .EB10SmallHead}

> *As America sank deeper into the quagmire of the Vietnam War in 1968, President Johnson was spiritually and physically exhausted. Television screens were filled with images of horror showing the devastation of Vietnam, the sufferings of its people and the sufferings of American soldiers.*
>
> *On 20 January, the Vietcong launched the Tet offensive, which involved American troops in desperate battles for control of their bases at Da Nang and `<?pagebreak number="382" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter033.html_p382}Khe Sanh and even the grounds of the US embassy in Saigon. Robert Kennedy and Eugene McCarthy were openly campaigning for the Democratic nomination for the presidential election. Johnson, who said in his memoirs that he had always intended to retire at the end of his first full term, read the signals.*
>
> *He hoped that by suspending the bombing of North Vietnam he would open the way to peace negotiations and accepted that his candidacy would both split the Democrats further and weaken the United States' negotiating position.*
>
> *Johnson prepared two perorations for his speech, given from the White House at the end of March. At 9.35 p.m. and well into his speech, his mind was made up. Watched by eighty-five million Americans, his face registering powerful emotions, he glanced at his wife and raised his right arm -- the prearranged signal that he was going, after all, to speak the extra words that had been prepared.*
>
> *Then the president looked into the camera. 'Fifty-two months and ten days ago ...' he began, and gave up his burden.*

Of those to whom much is given, much is asked. I cannot say and no man could say that no more will be asked of us.

Yet, I believe that now, no less than when the decade began, this generation of Americans is willing to 'pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty'.

Since those words were spoken by John F. Kennedy, the people of America have kept that compact with mankind's noblest cause.

And we shall continue to keep it.

Yet, I believe we must always be mindful of this one thing, whatever the trials and the tests ahead. The ultimate strength of our country and our cause will lie not in powerful weapons or infinite resources or boundless wealth, but will lie in the unity of our people.

This I believe very deeply.

Throughout my entire public career I have followed the personal philosophy that I am a free man, an American, a public servant, and a member of my party, in that order always and only.

For thirty-seven years in the service of our Nation, first as a Congressman, as a Senator, and as Vice-President, and now as your President, I have put the unity of the people first. I have put it ahead of any divisive partisanship.

`<?pagebreak number="383" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter033.html_p383}And in these times as in times before, it is true that a house divided against itself by the spirit of faction, of party, of region, of religion, of race, is a house that cannot stand.

There is division in the American house now. There is divisiveness among us all tonight. And holding the trust that is mine, as President of all the people, I cannot disregard the peril to the progress of the American people and the hope and the prospect of peace for all peoples.

So, I would ask all Americans, whatever their personal interests or concern, to guard against divisiveness and all its ugly consequences.

Fifty-two months and ten days ago, in a moment of tragedy and trauma, the duties of this office fell upon me. I asked then for your help and God's, that we might continue America on its course, binding up our wounds, healing our history, moving forward in new unity, to clear the American agenda and to keep the American commitment for all of our people.

United we have kept that commitment. United we have enlarged that commitment.

Through all time to come, I think America will be a stronger nation, a more just society, and a land of greater opportunity and fulfilment because of what we have all done together in these years of unparalleled achievement.

Our reward will come in the life of freedom, peace, and hope that our children will enjoy through ages ahead.

What we won when all of our people united just must not now be lost in suspicion, distrust, selfishness, and politics among any of our people.

Believing this as I do, I have concluded that I should not permit the Presidency to become involved in the partisan divisions that are developing in this political year.

With America's sons in the fields far away, with America's future under challenge right here at home, with our hopes and the world's hopes for peace in the balance every day, I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office -- the Presidency of your country.

`<?pagebreak number="384" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter033.html_p384}Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President.

But let men everywhere know, however, that a strong, a confident, and a vigilant America stands ready tonight to seek an honourable peace -- and stands ready tonight to defend an honoured cause -- whatever the price, whatever the burden, whatever the sacrifice that duty may require.
