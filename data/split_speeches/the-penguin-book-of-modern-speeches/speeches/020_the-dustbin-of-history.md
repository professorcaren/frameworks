> *Trotsky (1879--1940) was arrested as a revolutionary at the age of eighteen and sent to Siberia, where he escaped to join Lenin in London in 1902. He was back in St Petersburg in 1905, organizing the First Soviet. Again arrested and sent to Siberia, he escaped and spent several years as a revolutionary organizer in central Europe and beyond.*
>
> *He returned to Petrograd (ex-St Petersburg) from America in May 1917 and was chairman of the Petrograd Soviet during the October revolution. Trotsky made this speech at the meeting of the Soviet Congress, one of the most often-quoted speeches of the century, when he denounced a resolution for a coalition government of all the Soviet parties, led by the Menshevik leader, Yuli Martov.*

`<?pagebreak number="66" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter005.html_p66}What has taken place, is an insurrection, not a conspiracy. An insurrection of the popular masses needs no justification. We have tempered and hardened the revolutionary energy of the Petrograd workers and soldiers. We have openly forged the will of the masses to insurrection, and not conspiracy ... Our insurrection has conquered, and now we are told: Renounce your victory; make concessions, compromise. With whom? I ask: With whom ought we to make a compromise? With that pitiful handful who just went out? ... Haven't we seen them through and through? There is no longer anybody in Russia who is for them. Are the millions of workers and peasants represented in this Congress, whom they are ready now as always to turn over for a price to the mercies of the bourgeoisie, are they to enter a compromise with these men? No, a compromise is no good here. To those who have left, and to all who tell us to do this, we must say, 'You are pitiful isolated individuals; you are miserable bankrupts; your role is played out. Go where you belong from now on -- into the dustbin of history!'

> *In his award-winning account of the Russian Revolution,* A People's Tragedy, *Orlando Figes describes what happened next: 'In a moment of rage which he must have agonized over for the rest of his life, Martov, an old comrade of Lenin's, shouted: "Then we'll leave!" and walked in silence towards the exit without looking back -- into the political wilderness*.'
