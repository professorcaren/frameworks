#### 'Either we do it -- or they crush us' {#chapter008.html_pen0000853 .EB10SmallHead}

> *After assisting Lenin in Petrograd, Joseph Stalin (1879--1953) became the Bolsheviks' first Commissar for Nationalities and helped to defend Petrograd during the Civil War. At the party congress in 1923 he seized control of the party machine and manoeuvred to deny power to Trotsky. He succeeded Lenin and created one of the worst dictatorial tyrannies of the century. In 1928 he began his policy of achieving Socialism in One Country through the five-year plans.*
>
> *About 1,500 big enterprises were built during the first five-year plan, including the largest power station in Europe; new sectors of industry were established; thousands of kilometres of roads and canals were constructed; and many new cities were built. It was a gigantic achievement, won at appalling cost in human lives.*
>
> *Yet although there was mounting strain in the country, Stalin was still unsatisfied with the rate of progress and in this speech to industrial managers he appealed to the spirit of Russian nationalism to goad workers towards the social and economic transformation he sought to impose on the Russians.*
>
> *His message was simple -- either we do it or the West crushes us; and as his speech turned to the spirit of old Russia his words began to throb with the emotion that was mostly lacking from his lifeless oratory.*

It is sometimes asked whether it is not possible to slow down the tempo somewhat, to put a check on the movement. No, comrades, it is not possible! The tempo must not be reduced! On the contrary, we must increase it as much as is within our powers and possibilities. This is dictated to us by our obligations to the workers and peasants of the USSR. This is dictated to us by our obligations to the working class of the whole world.

To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we `<?pagebreak number="114" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter008.html_p114}refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual defeats she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her -- because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because to do so was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: 'You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.' Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: 'You are abundant,' so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: 'You are poor and impotent,' so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters -- to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak -- therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty -- therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.

That is why we must no longer lag behind.

In the past we had no fatherland, nor could we have had one. But now that we have overthrown capitalism and power is in our hands, in the hands of the people, we have a fatherland, and we will uphold its independence. Do you want our socialist fatherland to be beaten and to lose its independence? If you do not want this, you must put an end to its backwardness in the shortest possible time and develop a genuine Bolshevik tempo in building up its socialist economy. There is no other way. That is why Lenin said on the eve of the October Revolution: 'Either perish, or overtake and outstrip the advanced capitalist countries.'

We are fifty or a hundred years behind the advanced countries. We must make good this distance in ten years. Either we do it, or they crush us.

That is what our obligations to the workers and peasants of the USSR dictate to us.

`<?pagebreak number="115" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter008.html_p115}In ten years at most we must make good the distance that separates us from the advanced capitalist countries. We have all the 'objective' possibilities for this. The only thing lacking is the ability to make proper use of these possibilities. And that depends on us. *Only* on us! It is time we learned to make use of these possibilities. It is time to put an end to the rotten line of non-interference in production. It is time to adopt a new line, one corresponding to the present period -- the line of *interfering in everything*. If you are a factory manager -- interfere in all the affairs of the factory, look into everything, let nothing escape you, learn and learn again. Bolsheviks must master technique. It is time Bolsheviks themselves became experts. In the period of reconstruction, technique decides everything. And a business executive who does not want to study technique, who does not want to master technique, is a joke and not an executive.

It is said that it is hard to master technique. That is not true! There are no fortresses that Bolsheviks cannot capture. We have solved a number of most difficult problems. We have overthrown capitalism. We have assumed power. We have built up a huge socialist industry. We have transferred the middle peasants on to the path of socialism. We have already accomplished what is most important from the point of view of construction. What remains to be done is not so much: to study technique, to master science. And when we have done that we shall develop a tempo of which we dare not even dream at present.

And we shall do it if we really want to.
