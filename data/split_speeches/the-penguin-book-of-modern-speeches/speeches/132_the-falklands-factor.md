#### 'The Falklands Factor' {#chapter037.html_pen0003486 .EB10SmallHead}

> *When Margaret Thatcher decided to send a task force of 10,000 men to recapture the Falkland Islands after they had been invaded by Argentina, she played for the highest stakes and won triumphantly. The British success was attributed to Mrs Thatcher's nerve and determination. The 'Iron Lady' of Soviet propaganda proved iron indeed. From being the least popular British prime minister of modern times, Mrs Thatcher became the new Boadicea, the embodiment of toughness and resolve.*

> *The 'Falklands Factor', noted in this nationalistic speech to a rally of Conservative women, ensured that she won the general election of 1983, her second election victory.*

Today we meet in the aftermath of the Falklands Battle. Our country has won a great victory and we are entitled to be proud. This nation had the resolution to do what it knew had to be done -- to do what it knew was right.

We fought to show that aggression does not pay, and that the robber cannot be allowed to get away with his swag. We fought with the support of so many throughout the world: the Security Council, the Commonwealth, the European Community, and the United States. Yet we also fought alone -- for we fought for our own people and for our own sovereign territory.

Now that it is all over, things cannot be the same again, for we have learnt something about ourselves -- a lesson which we desperately needed to learn. When we started out, there were the waverers and the faint-hearts: the people who thought that Britain could no longer seize the initiative for herself; the people who thought we could no longer do the great things which we once did; and those who believed that our decline was irreversible -- that we could never again be what we were. There were those who would not admit it -- even perhaps `<?pagebreak number="436" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter037.html_p436}some here today -- people who would have strenuously denied the suggestion but -- in their heart of hearts -- they too had their secret fears that it was true: that Britain was no longer the nation that had built an Empire and ruled a quarter of the world.

Well, they were wrong. The lesson of the Falklands is that Britain has not changed and that this nation still has those sterling qualities which shine through our history. This generation can match their fathers and grandfathers in ability, in courage, and in resolution. We have not changed. When the demands of war and the dangers to our own people call us to arms -- then we British are as we have always been -- competent, courageous and resolute.

When called to arms -- ah, that's the problem. It took the battle in the South Atlantic for the shipyards to adapt ships way ahead of time; for dockyards to refit merchantmen and cruise liners, to fix helicopter platforms, to convert hospital ships -- all faster than was thought possible; it took the demands of war for every stop to be pulled out and every man and woman to do their best.

British people had to be threatened by foreign soldiers and British territory invaded and then -- why then -- the response was incomparable. Yet why does it need a war to bring out our qualities and reassert our pride? Why do we have to be invaded before we throw aside our selfish aims and begin to work together as only we can work, and achieve as only we can achieve?

That really is the challenge we as a nation face today. We have to see that the spirit of the South Atlantic -- the real spirit of Britain -- is kindled not only by war but can now be fired by peace.

We have the first prerequisite. We know we can do it -- we haven't lost the ability. That is the Falklands Factor. We have proved ourselves to ourselves. It is a lesson we must not now forget. Indeed, it is a lesson which we must apply to peace just as we have learnt it in war. The faltering and the self-doubt has given way to achievement and pride. We have the confidence and we must use it.

Just look at the Task Force as an object lesson. Every man had his own task to do and did it superbly. Officers and men, senior NCO and newest recruit -- every one realized that his contribution was essential for the success of the whole. All were equally valuable -- each `<?pagebreak number="437" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter037.html_p437}was differently qualified. By working together, each was able to do more than his best. As a team they raised the average to the level of the best and by each doing his utmost together they achieved the impossible. That's an accurate picture of Britain at war -- not yet of Britain at peace. But the spirit has stirred and the nation has begun to assert itself. Things are not going to be the same again.
