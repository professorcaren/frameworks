#### 'Let's talk sense to the American people' {#chapter023.html_pen0002025 .EB10SmallHead}

> *When the Republicans selected General Eisenhower as their presidential candidate in 1952, the Democrats responded by nominating their best man, Governor Adlai Stevenson (1900--1965) of Illinois, who had proved himself an effective reforming governor.*
>
> *Until then, few Americans had heard of Stevenson, although he had served in government, been a delegate to the UN General Assembly and was elected governor of Illinois by a record-breaking half million votes in 1948.*
>
> *As Stevenson accepted the Democratic nomination, the nation heard for the first time the eloquence that made him so memorable a speaker.*

The ordeal of the twentieth century -- the bloodiest, most turbulent era of the Christian age -- is far from over. Sacrifice, patience, understanding, and implacable purpose may be our lot for years to come.

`<?pagebreak number="253" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter023.html_p253}Let's face it. Let's talk sense to the American people. Let's tell them the truth, that there are no gains without pains, that we are now on the eve of great decisions, not easy decisions, like resistance when you're attacked, but a long, patient, costly struggle which alone can assure triumph over the great enemies of man -- war, poverty, and tyranny -- and the assaults upon human dignity which are the most grievous consequences of each.

Let's tell them that the victory to be won in the twentieth century, this portal to the golden age, mocks the pretensions of individual acumen and ingenuity. For it is a citadel guarded by thick walls of ignorance and mistrust which do not fall before the trumpets' blast or the politicians' imprecations or even a general's baton. They are, my friends, walls that must be directly stormed by the hosts of courage, morality, and of vision, standing shoulder to shoulder, unafraid of ugly truth, contemptuous of lies, half-truths, circuses, and demagoguery.

The people are wise -- wiser than the Republicans think. And the Democratic party is the people's party, not the labour party, not the farmers' party, not the employers' party -- it is the party of no one because it is the party of everyone.

That, I think, is our ancient mission. Where we have deserted it we have failed. With your help there will be no desertion now. Better we lose the election than mislead the people; and better we lose than misgovern the people.

Help me do the job in this autumn of conflict and of campaign; help me to do the job in these years of darkness, of doubt, and of crisis which stretch beyond the horizon of tonight's happy vision, and we will justify our glorious past and the loyalty of silent millions who look to us for compassion, for understanding, and for honest purpose. Thus we will serve our great tradition greatly.

I ask of you all you have; I will give to you all I have, even as he who came here tonight and honoured me, as he has honoured you -- the Democratic party -- by a lifetime of service and bravery that will find him an imperishable page in the history of the Republic and of the Democratic party -- President Harry S. Truman.

And finally, my friends, in the staggering task that you have assigned `<?pagebreak number="254" ?>`{=html}[]{#chapter023.html_p254}me, I shall always try 'to do justly, to love mercy, and walk humbly with my God'.

*Eisenhower won the election by a landslide and Stevenson lost again in 1956 -- but his liberalism captured a generation of Democrats, saved the Republicans from falling back into the clutches of the Southern conservatives, and prepared the way for the reformers of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.*
