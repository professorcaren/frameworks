## 'An	honest,	loyal,	strong,	popular	government'

23	June	1960,	Léopoldville	(now	Kinshasa),	Congo

This	speech	represents	a	brief	dawn	of	optimism	in	the	stormy	history	of Congolese	politics.	Lumumba	gave	this	exhilarated	address	to	the	Congolese Chamber	a	week	before	independence	was	officially	declared.	It	was preceded	by	the	announcement	of	the	Cabinet,	in	which	Lumumba	held	the twin	posts	of	prime	minister	and	Minister	of	National	Defence.

In	his	speech,	translated	here	by	H	R	Lane,	Lumumba	commends	the government	to	the	Chamber	and	expresses	his	desire	to	establish	law	and order.	He	also	attempts	to	position	the	country	as	truly	independent,	aligned to	neither	the	USA	nor	the	USSR,	though	he	does	acknowledge	the	need	for Belgian	support.

Mr	President,	dear	colleagues,	ladies	and	gentlemen:	the	crisis	that threatened	to	endanger	the	future	of	our	young	nation	has	fortunately	been resolved,	thanks	to	the	Congolese	wisdom	that	all	the	elected	representatives have	shown	in	the	face	of	the	danger	that	confronted	us.	You	have	been	the	first to	demonstrate	to	everyone	that	is	our	duty	to	bring	about	union	and	solidarity…

Today,	in	victory,	in	triumph,	we	are	still	united	and	unanimous:	our	entire nation	rejoices	at	this.

Gentlemen:	the	government	that	you	are	about	to	vote	on	is	an	honest,	loyal, strong,	popular	government,	which	represents	the	entire	nation,	having	been chosen	by	you	to	serve	the	interests	of	our	homeland.	All	the	members	of	my team	and	I	formally	pledge	that	this	government	will	remain	a	government	of	the people,	by	the	people	and	for	the	people. 1

Strengthened	by	this	popular	support,	the	government	will	endeavour	to	keep	the nation's	territory	and	its	unity	intact	and	protect	it	from	attack	from	any	quarter.

The	vastness	of	the	territory	and	its	great	diversity	make	certain	steps	necessary, however.	The	government	views	this	situation	realistically.	We	must	be	able	to modify	the	administrative	divisions	of	the	old	regime	by	legal	means	so	that each	citizen	may	find	happiness	among	his	fellows.

This	government	will	endeavour	to	establish	the	rule	of	law	and	order everywhere	in	the	country,	without	hesitating;	but	as	it	goes	about	this	task,	it will	always	respect	the	inalienable	rights	of	man	and	the	citizen	as	a	sacred good.

This	government	will	consider	its	first	duty	to	be	that	of	leading	the	popular masses	along	the	path	to	social	justice,	wellbeing	and	progress,	carefully avoiding	adventures	that	might	lead	to	catastrophes	that	we	wish	to	spare	our people.	We	want	nothing	to	do	with	new	forms	of	dictatorship.

This	government	will	endeavour	to	maintain	friendly	relations	with	all	foreign countries,	but	it	will	not	succumb	to	the	temptations	of	joining	one	or	another	of the	blocs	that	have	now	divided	the	world	between	them,	as	it	might	so	easily do;	it	will	also	not	hesitate	to	espouse	a	noble	and	just	cause	on	the	international plane,	and	in	Africa	in	particular.

Gentlemen:	in	the	name	of	the	government	of	the	Congo,	in	the	name	of	the Congolese	people	and	also	in	the	certainty	that	I	am	speaking	for	all	the members	of	this	parliament,	I	now	address	our	Belgian	friends	in	particular,	and have	this	to	say	to	them:	in	the	last	three-quarters	of	a	century,	you	have	created an	enormous	handiwork	in	this	country.	It	was	not	always	immune	to	criticism, certainly,	but	now	that	the	outrages	perpetrated	during	the	elections	are	at	an end,	we	must	recognize	that	it	constitutes	the	unshakable	foundation	on	which we	are	going	to	build	our	nation	together…

We	will	need	the	help	of	Belgians	and	of	all	men	of	goodwill	more	than	ever;	we will	do	our	utmost	to	ensure	that	the	co-operation	that	will	begin	tomorrow	will be	of	benefit	to	all.	The	religious	missions	will	be	assured	of	being	able	to continue	their	apostolate,	thanks	to	the	freedom	of	opinion	and	the	religious freedom	that	our	constitution	will	guarantee.	The	members	of	the	former colonial	administration	have	now	turned	their	powers	of	government	over	to	the Congolese,	but	their	counsel	and	their	experience	will	remain	the	surest guarantee	of	sound	government.

Lastly,	you	will	understand	why	I	wish	to	conclude	my	remarks	with	an expression	of	the	overwhelming	emotion	I	feel.	The	members	of	the	first government	of	the	Congo	are	faced	with	a	grave	task,	and	they	are	well	aware	of how	complex	it	is.	We	are	face	to	face	with	an	immense	country,	with extraordinary	potentialities.	We	have	at	our	side	a	young,	resolute,	intelligent people	capable	of	being	the	equal	of	other	nations.

We	are	privileged	to	be	beginning	our	national	life	at	the	same	time	as	other countries	in	Africa.

## This	huge	continent	is	awakening	and	looking	toward	a better	future.

The	Congolese	people	will	fulfil	its	destiny	through	unity	and	solidarity.

Gentlemen:	whether	or	not	this	destiny	is	a	happy	one	and	one	truly	worthy	of our	people	will	depend	on	each	one	of	us,	on	our	work	each	day	of	our	lives.	I am	proud	to	see	the	Congo,	our	homeland,	take	its	place	in	the	ranks	of	free peoples.

May	I	ask	you,	dear	brothers,	on	this	solemn	day	on	which	the	Congo	is achieving	its	total	independence,	on	which	a	democratic	government	is	taking over,	on	which	justice	is	being	established,	on	which	each	of	us	will	henceforth enjoy	total	personal	freedom,	on	which	the	sun	has	suddenly	come	out	in	this country	to	dissipate	the	long	darkness	of	the	colonial	regime,	to	raise	your	voices with	me:

Long	live	the	independent	Congo!

Long	live	the	united	Congo!

Long	live	freedom!
