## 'As	we	leave	the	European	Union,	we	will	forge	a	bold new	positive	role	for	ourselves	in	the	world'

13	July	2016,	London,	England

After	a	nationwide	referendum	on	23	June	2016,	the	United	Kingdom	voted to	leave	the	European	Union	after	42	years	as	a	member	state.	The	'Brexit' vote	followed	increasing	growing	disenchantment	with	Brussels	but	it	still came	as	something	of	a	shock	when	the	UK	electorate	voted	by	51.9	per	cent to	48.9	per	cent	to	leave.	The	campaigning	prior	to	the	vote	was	prickly	and contentious,	with	issues	centred	on	the	economy,	immigration	and	national sovereignty.

Cameron	resigned	the	day	after	the	vote,	sparking	a	series	of	leadership	bids from	Remain	and	Leave	campaigners	from	within	the	Conservative	Party. Battling	through	the	pack	came	Home	Secretary	Theresa	May,	a	Remain campaigner	and	longtime	member	of	Cameron's	cabinet,	who	maintained popular	support	from	the	backbenches	to	secure	the	nomination	and	become the	second	woman	to	become	UK	Prime	Minster.

May's	first	statement	as	Prime	Minister,	delivered	outside	10	Downing Street,	reveals	her	vision	for	Britain	under	her	premiership.	Her	primary intention	was	to	appeal	for	unity	and	to	direct	that	appeal	to	the	widest possible	audience.	After	first	praising	Cameron,	May	briskly	addresses	a broad	cross-section	of	British	society,	listing	typical	challenges	faced	by	the public	on	a	day-to-day	basis	and	outlining	a	mission	to	improve	the	prospects of	everyone	in	the	United	Kingdom.	The	inclusive	principles	she	espouses are	essentially	those	of	'one-nation'	Toryism	-	a	phrase	coined	by	the Victorian	Tory	prime	minister	Benjamin	Disraeli.

I	have	just	been	to	Buckingham	Palace,	where	Her	Majesty	The	Queen	has asked	me	to	form	a	new	government,	and	I	accepted.

In	David	Cameron,	I	follow	in	the	footsteps	of	a	great,	modern	prime	minister. Under	David's	leadership,	the	government	stabilised	the	economy,	reduced	the budget	deficit,	and	helped	more	people	into	work	than	ever	before.

But	David's	true	legacy	is	not	about	the	economy	but	about	social	justice.	From the	introduction	of	same-sex	marriage, 1 	to	taking	people	on	low	wages	out	of income	tax	altogether;	David	Cameron	has	led	a	one-nation	government,	and	it is	in	that	spirit	that	I	also	plan	to	lead.

## Because	not	everybody	knows	this,	but	the	full	title	of my	party	is	the	Conservative	and	Unionist	Party,	and that	word	'unionist'	is	very	important	to	me.

It	means	we	believe	in	the	Union:	the	precious,	precious	bond	between	England, Scotland,	Wales	and	Northern	Ireland. 2 	But	it	means	something	else	that	is	just as	important;	it	means	we	believe	in	a	union	not	just	between	the	nations	of	the United	Kingdom	but	between	all	of	our	citizens,	every	one	of	us,	whoever	we are	and	wherever	we're	from.

That	means	fighting	against	the	burning	injustice	that,	if	you're	born	poor,	you will	die	on	average	nine	years	earlier	than	others.

If	you're	black,	you're	treated	more	harshly	by	the	criminal	justice	system	than if	you're	white.

If	you're	a	white,	working-class	boy,	you're	less	likely	than	anybody	else	in Britain	to	go	to	university.

If	you're	at	a	state	school,	you're	less	likely	to	reach	the	top	professions	than	if you're	educated	privately.

If	you're	a	woman,	you	will	earn	less	than	a	man.	If	you	suffer	from	mental health	problems,	there's	not	enough	help	to	hand.

If	you're	young,	you'll	find	it	harder	than	ever	before	to	own	your	own	home.

But	the	mission	to	make	Britain	a	country	that	works	for	everyone	means	more than	fighting	these	injustices.	If	you're	from	an	ordinary	working-class	family, life	is	much	harder	than	many	people	in	Westminster	realize.	You	have	a	job	but you	don't	always	have	job	security.	You	have	your	own	home,	but	you	worry about	paying	a	mortgage.	You	can	just	about	manage	but	you	worry	about	the cost	of	living	and	getting	your	kids	into	a	good	school.

If	you're	one	of	those	families,	if	you're	just	managing,	I	want	to	address	you directly.

I	know	you're	working	around	the	clock,	I	know	you're	doing	your	best,	and	I know	that	sometimes	life	can	be	a	struggle.	The	government	I	lead	will	be	driven not	by	the	interests	of	the	privileged	few,	but	by	yours.

We	will	do	everything	we	can	to	give	you	more	control	over	your	lives.	When we	take	the	big	calls,	we'll	think	not	of	the	powerful,	but	you.	When	we	pass new	laws,	we'll	listen	not	to	the	mighty	but	to	you.	When	it	comes	to	taxes, we'll	prioritize	not	the	wealthy,	but	you.	When	it	comes	to	opportunity,	we won't	entrench	the	advantages	of	the	fortunate	few.	We	will	do	everything	we can	to	help	anybody,	whatever	your	background,	to	go	as	far	as	your	talents	will take	you.

## We	are	living	through	an	important	moment	in	our country's	history.	Following	the	referendum,	we	face	a time	of	great	national	change.

And	I	know	because	we're	Great	Britain,	that	we	will	rise	to	the	challenge.	As we	leave	the	European	Union,	we	will	forge	a	bold	new	positive	role	for ourselves	in	the	world,	and	we	will	make	Britain	a	country	that	works	not	for	a privileged	few,	but	for	every	one	of	us.

That	will	be	the	mission	of	the	government	I	lead,	and	together	we	will	build	a better	Britain.
