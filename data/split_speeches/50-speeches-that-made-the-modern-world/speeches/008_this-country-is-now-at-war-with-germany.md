## 'This	country	is	now	at	war	with	Germany'

3	September	1939,	radio	broadcast	from	London,	England

Adolf	Hitler	had	agreed	a	ten-year	non-aggression	pact	with	Poland	in	1934, but	early	in	1939	he	began	laying	claim	to	the	'Polish	Corridor',	which divided	Germany	from	the	Baltic	and	included	the	port	of	Gdánsk	(known	as Danzig	to	the	Germans).	Poland	rejected	this	territorial	claim	and	received guarantees	of	support	from	France	and	Britain.	By	early	April,	Hitler	had formulated	a	plan	for	the	invasion	of	Poland,	and	at	the	end	of	the	month	he renounced	the	Polish-German	non-aggression	pact.	Meanwhile,	diplomacy continued	between	Poland,	Britain	and	France,	which	eventually	led	to military	alliances	being	expanded	and	formalized.	On	23	August, Chamberlain	warned	Hitler	that	Britain	would	stand	by	Poland,	though	the treaty	was	not	signed	until	25	August.	Meanwhile,	the	Nazis	were	signing their	own	alliance	with	Russia,	the	Molotov-Ribbentrop	Pact,	which	they would	violate	in	due	course.

When	Germany	finally	invaded	Poland	on	1	September,	the	British	people had	little	wish	to	go	to	war,	but	Chamberlain	saw	there	was	no	alternative. Hitler's	expansionist	aspirations	were	now	unmistakable,	and	the	policies espoused	by	the	Nazis	had	made	Europe	increasingly	dangerous.

Britain,	together	with	France,	was	obliged	to	declare	war	on	Germany.	In this	famous	radio	broadcast	to	the	British	people,	the	Prime	Minister	outlines the	events	that	had	made	this	declaration	unavoidable.

This	morning,	the	British	ambassador	in	Berlin	handed	the	German government	a	final	note,	stating	that	unless	we	heard	from	them	by	eleven o'clock	that	they	were	prepared	at	once	to	withdraw	their	troops	from	Poland,	a state	of	war	would	exist	between	us.

I	have	to	tell	you	now	that	no	such	undertaking	has	been	received	and	that consequently	this	country	is	at	war	with	Germany.

You	can	imagine	what	a	bitter	blow	it	is	to	me	that	all	my	long	struggle	to	win peace	has	failed,	yet	I	cannot	believe	that	there	is	anything	more,	or	anything different,	that	I	could	have	done	and	that	would	have	been	more	successful.	Up to	the	very	last,	it	would	have	been	quite	possible	to	arrange	a	peaceful	and honourable	settlement	between	Germany	and	Poland,	but	Hitler	would	not	have it.	He	had	evidently	made	up	his	mind	to	attack	Poland	whatever	happened;	and although	he	now	says	he	put	forward	reasonable	proposals	which	were	rejected by	the	Poles,	that	is	not	a	true	statement.	The	proposals	were	never	shown	to	the Poles,	nor	to	us.	And	though	they	were	announced	in	the	German	broadcast	on Thursday	night,	Hitler	did	not	wait	to	hear	comments	on	them,	but	ordered	his troops	to	cross	the	Polish	frontier	the	next	morning.

His	action	shows	convincingly	that	there	is	no	chance	of	expecting	that	this	man will	ever	give	up	his	practice	of	using	force	to	gain	his	will.

He	can	only	be	stopped	by	force.

We	and	France	are	today,	in	fulfilment	of	our	obligations,	going	to	the	aid	of Poland,	who	is	so	bravely	resisting	this	wicked	and	unprovoked	attack	on	her people.	We	have	a	clear	conscience.	We	have	done	all	that	any	country	could	do to	establish	peace.	The	situation	in	which	no	word	given	by	Germany's	ruler could	be	trusted	and	no	people	or	country	could	feel	themselves	safe	has	become intolerable.	And	now	that	we	have	resolved	to	finish	it,	I	know	that	you	will	all play	your	part	with	calmness	and	courage.

When	I	have	finished	speaking,	certain	detailed	announcements	will	be	made	on behalf	of	the	government.	Give	these	your	closest	attention.	The	government have	made	plans	under	which	it	will	be	possible	to	carry	on	the	work	of	the nation	in	the	days	of	stress	and	strain	that	may	be	ahead.	But	these	plans	need your	help.	You	may	be	taking	your	part	in	the	fighting	services,	or	as	a	volunteer in	one	of	the	branches	of	civil	defence.	If	so,	you	will	report	for	duty	in accordance	with	the	instructions	you	have	received.	You	may	be	engaged	in work	essential	to	the	prosecution	of	war	or	for	the	maintenance	of	the	life	of	the people	-	in	factories,	in	transport,	in	public	utility	concerns,	or	in	the	supply	of other	necessaries	of	life.	If	so,	it	is	of	vital	importance	that	you	should	carry	on with	your	jobs.

Now	may	God	bless	you	all.	May	he	defend	the	right.

It	is	the	evil	things	that	we	shall	be	fighting	against	-	brute	force,	bad	faith, injustice,	oppression	and	persecution	-	and	against	them	I	am	certain	that	the right	will	prevail.

'1 have, myself, full confidence that if all do their we shall prove ourselves once again able to defend our island home, to ride out the storm of war and to outlive the menace of tyranny duty

Winston Churchill

## Winston	Churchill

British	statesman	and	historian

Winston	Leonard	Spencer	Churchill	(1874-1965),	an	aristocratic	Conservative MP	who	had	served	in	a	number	of	governmental	positions	including	those	of Home	Secretary	and	Minister	of	Munitions,	had	warned	of	the	rising	Nazi	threat in	the	mid-1930s.	In	1940	Neville	Chamberlain	stepped	down	and	Churchill became	prime	minister,	seeing	Britain	through	World	War	II,	one	of	the	most momentous	periods	in	its	history.	Churchill	quickly	gained	the	loyalty	of	the British	people	and	the	confidence	of	the	Allies.	He	was	an	accomplished	orator, able	to	convince	audiences	that	Britain	would	eventually	prevail,	even	in	the blackest	moments.
