## 'They	thought	that	the	bullets	would	silence	us.	But	they failed.'

12	July	2013,	New	York,	USA

The	world	already	knew	about	the	extraordinary	courage	and	determination of	Malala	Yousafzai	long	before	the	'Youth	Takeover'	event	at	the	United Nations	headquarters,	dubbed	Malala	Day	in	her	honour.	But	few	can	have imagined	that	she	would	deliver	this	speech	with	such	composure	and	clarity, just	nine	months	after	a	near-fatal	injury.	Standing	almost	perfectly	still,	she spoke	with	quiet	confidence	and	dignity	under	the	world's	gaze.	Her	key message	-	delivered	in	support	of	the	United	Nations'	'Education	First' initiative	-	was	the	importance	of	education	and	the	right	of	everyone	to receive	it.

She	establishes	her	credentials	as	a	devout	Muslim	at	the	beginning	of	her speech,	but	later	cites	the	figureheads	of	other	world	religions,	as	well	as secular	figures	who	have	espoused	non-violent	activism.	Islam,	she	insists,	is a	peaceful	religion	which	encourages	learning	for	all	children.	She	repudiates hatred	for	her	cowardly	would-be	assassin,	instead	calling	on	the	Taliban	to allow	their	children	to	be	educated.

In	the	name	of	God,	the	Most	Beneficent,	The	Most	Merciful. 1

Honourable	UN	Secretary	General	Mr	Ban	Ki-moon, 2

Respected	President	General	Assembly	Vuk	Jeremić, 3

Honourable	UN	envoy	for	global	education	Mr	Gordon	Brown, 4

Respected	elders	and	my	dear	brothers	and	sisters;

As-salamu	alaykum . 5 [Repeated	in	response	by	some	audience	members.]

Today,	it	is	an	honour	for	me	to	be	speaking	again	after	a	long	time. 6 	Being	here with	such	honourable	people	is	a	great	moment	in	my	life,	and	it's	an	honour	for me	that	today	I	am	wearing	today	a	shawl	of	Benazir	Bhutto	Shaheed. 7

I	don't	know	where	to	begin	my	speech.	I	don't	know	what	people	would	be expecting	me	to	say.

But	first	of	all,	thank	you	to	God	for	whom	we	all	are	equal	and	thank	you	to every	person	who	has	prayed	for	my	fast	recovery	and	a	new	life.	I	cannot believe	how	much	love	people	have	shown	me.	I	have	received	thousands	of good	wish	cards	and	gifts	from	all	over	the	world.	Thank	you	to	all	of	them. Thank	you	to	the	children	whose	innocent	words	encouraged	me.	Thank	you	to my	elders	whose	prayers	strengthened	me.

I	would	like	to	thank	my	nurses,	doctors	and	the	staff	of	the	hospitals	in	Pakistan and	the	UK,	and	the	UAE	government, 8 	who	have	helped	me	get	better	and recover	my	strength.	I	fully	support	Mr	Ban	Ki-moon,	the	Secretary-General,	in his	Global	Education	First	Initiative	and	the	work	of	the	UN	Special	Envoy,	Mr Gordon	Brown,	and	the	respected	President	General	Assembly	Vuk	Jeremić.	I thank	all	of	them	for	the	leadership	they	continue	to	give.	They	continue	to inspire	all	of	us	to	action.

## Dear	brothers	and	sisters,	do	remember	one	thing. Malala	Day	is	not	my	day.	Today	is	the	day	of	every woman,	every	boy	and	every	girl	who	have	raised	their voice	for	their	rights.

There	are	hundreds	of	human	rights	activists	and	social	workers	who	are	not only	speaking	for	their	rights,	but	who	are	struggling	to	achieve	their	goals	of peace,	education	and	equality.	Thousands	of	people	have	been	killed	by	the terrorists	and	millions	have	been	injured.	I	am	just	one	of	them.

So	here	I	stand…so	here	I	stand,	one	girl	among	many.

I	speak	not	for	myself,	but	for	those	without	voice	can	be	heard.

Those	who	have	fought	for	their	rights:

Their	right	to	live	in	peace.	Their	right	to	be	treated	with	[slight	fluff]	dignity. Their	right	to	equality	of	opportunity.	Their	right	to	be	educated.

Dear	friends,	on	the	9th	of	October	2012,	the	Taliban	shot	me	on	the	left	side	of my	forehead.	They	shot	my	friends	too.	They	thought	that	the	bullets	would silence	us.	But	they	failed.	And	out	of	that	silence	came	thousands	of	voices.

The	terrorists	thought	that	they	would	change	my	aims and	stop	my	ambitions	but	nothing	changed	in	my	life except	this:	weakness,	fear	and	hopelessness	died. Strength,	power	and	courage	was	born.

[Prolonged	applause	and	cheers.] I	am	the	same	Malala.	My	ambitions	are	the same.	My	hopes	are	the	same.	And	my	dreams	are	the	same.

Dear	sisters	and	brothers,	I'm	not	against	anyone.	Neither	am	I	here	to	speak	in terms	of	personal	revenge	against	the	Taliban	or	any	other	terrorist	group.	I	am here	to	speak	up	for	the	right	of	education	of	every	child.

[Applause.] I	want	education	for	the	sons	and	daughters	of	the	Taliban	and	all terrorists	and	extremists.

I	do	not	even	hate	the	Talib	who	shot	me.	Even	if	there	is	a	gun	in	my	hand	and he	stands	in	front	of	me,	I	would	not	shoot	him.	This	is	the	compassion	that	I have	learnt	from	Muhammad,	the	prophet	of	mercy,	and	Jesus	Christ	and	Lord Buddha.	This	is	the	legacy	of	change	that	I	have	inherited	from	Martin	Luther King,	Nelson	Mandela	and	Muhammad	Ali	Jinnah. 9 	This	is… [Interrupted	by applause.] This	is	the	philosophy	of	non-violence	that	I	have	learnt	from Gandhiji, 10 Bacha	Khan 11 	and	Mother	Teresa. 12 	And	this	is	the	forgiveness	that	I have	learned	from	my	father	and	from	my	mother [Applause.] This	is	what	my soul	is	telling	me:	be	peaceful	and	love	everyone.

Dear	sisters	and	brothers,	we	realise	the	importance	of	light	when	we	see darkness.	We	realise	the	importance	of	our	voice	when	we	are	silenced.	In	the same	way,	when	we	were	in	Swat 13 ,	the	north	of	Pakistan,	we	realised	the importance	of	pens	and	books	when	we	saw	the	guns.

The	wise	saying,	'The	pen	is	mightier	than	sword' 14 	was	true.	The	extremists were	and	they	are	afraid	of	books	and	pens.

The	power	of	education,	the	power	of	education	frightens	them.	They	are	afraid of	women.	The	power	of	the	voice	of	women	frightens	them.	And	that	is	why they	killed	14	innocent	students	in	the	recent	attack	in	Quetta. 15 And	that	is	why they	killed	female	teachers	and	polio	workers	in	Khyber	Pakhtunkhwa.	That	is why	they	are	blasting	schools	every	day.	Because	they	were	and	they	are	afraid of	change,	afraid	of	equality	that	we	will	bring	into	our	society.

And	I	remember	that	there	was	a	boy	in	our	school	who	was	asked	by	a journalist,	'Why	are	the	Taliban	against	education?'	He	answered	very	simply, by	pointing	to	his	book.	He	said,	'A	Talib	doesn't	know	what	is	written	inside this	book.'	They	think	that	God	is	a	tiny,	little	conservative	being	who	would send	girls	to	the	Hell	just	because	of	going	to	school.	The	terrorists	are	misusing the	name	of	Islam	and	Pashtun	society	for	their	own	personal	benefits. [Applause.]

Pakistan	is	peace-loving,	democratic	country.	Pashtuns	want	education	for	their daughters	and	sons.	And	Islam	is	a	religion	of	peace,	humanity	and	brotherhood. Islam	says	it's	not	only	each	child's	right	to	get	education,	rather	it's	their	duty and	responsibility.

Honourable	Secretary-General,	peace	is	necessary	for	education.	In	many	parts of	the	world,	especially	Pakistan	and	Afghanistan,	terrorism,	wars	and	conflicts stop	children	to	go	to	their	schools.	We	are	really	tired	of	these	wars.	Women and	children	are	suffering	in	many	ways	in	many	parts	of	the	world.	In	India, innocent	and	poor	children	are	victims	of	child	labour.	Many	schools	have	been destroyed	in	Nigeria. 16 People	in	Afghanistan	have	been	affected	by	the	hurdles of	extremism	for	decades.	Young	girls	have	to	do	domestic	child	labour	and	are forced	to	get	married	at	early	age.	Poverty,	ignorance,	injustice,	racism	and	the deprivation	of	basic	rights	are	the	main	problems	faced	by	both	men	and	women.

Dear	fellows,	today	I	am	focusing	on	women's	rights	and	girls'	education because	they	are	suffering	the	most.	There	was	a	time	when	women	social activists	asked	men	to	stand	up	for	their	rights.	But,	this	time,	we	will	do	it	by ourselves. [Cheers	and	applause.] I'm	not	telling	men	to	step	away	from speaking	for	women's	rights;	rather	I	am	focusing	on	women	to	be	independent to	fight	for	themselves.

So,	dear	sisters	and	brothers,	now	it's	time	to	speak	up.

So	today,	we	call	upon	the	world	leaders	to	change	their	strategic	policies	in favour	of	peace	and	prosperity.

We	call	upon	the	world	leaders	that	all	the	peace	deals	must	protect	women's and	children's	rights.	A	deal	that	goes	against	the	rights	of	women	is unacceptable.

We	call	upon	all	governments	to	ensure	free	compulsory	education	all	over	the world	for	every	child. [Applause.]

We	call	upon	all	the	governments	to	fight	against	terrorism	and	violence,	to protect	children	from	brutality	and	harm.

We	call	upon	the	developed	nations	to	support	the	expansion	of	educational opportunities	for	girls	in	the	developing	world.

We	call	upon	all	the	communities	to	be	tolerant,	to	reject	prejudice	based	on caste,	creed,	sect,	religion	or	gender.	To	ensure	freedom	and	equality	for	women so	that	they	can	flourish.	We	cannot	all	succeed	when	half	of	us	are	held	back.

We	call	upon	our	sisters	around	the	world	to	be	brave	to	embrace	the	strength	within	themselves	and	realise their	full	potential.

Dear	brothers	and	sisters,	we	want	schools	and	education	for	every	child's	bright future.	We	will	continue	our	journey	to	our	destination	of	peace	and	education. No	one	can	stop	us.	We	will	speak	up	for	our	rights	and	we	will	bring	change through	our	voice.	We	must	believe	in	the	power	and	the	strength	of	our	words. Our	words	can	change	the	whole	world,	because	we	are	all	together,	united	for the	cause	of	education.

And	if	we	want	to	achieve	our	goal,	then	let	us	empower	ourselves	with	the weapon	of	knowledge	and	let	us	shield	ourselves	with	unity	and	togetherness.

Dear	brothers	and	sisters,	we	must	not	forget	that	millions	of	people	are suffering	from	poverty,	injustice	and	ignorance.	We	must	not	forget	that	millions of	children	are	out	of	their	schools.	We	must	not	forget	that	our	sisters	and brothers	are	waiting	for	a	bright,	peaceful	future.

So	let	us	wage…so	let	us	wage	a	global	struggle	against	illiteracy,	poverty	and terrorism.	Let	us	pick	up…let	us	pick	up	our	books	and	our	pens.	They	are	our most	powerful	weapons.

## [Holding	up	a	finger.]

One	child,	one	teacher,	one	book	and	one	pen	can	change	the	world.

Education	is	the	only	solution.	Education	First.

Thank	you.

[Cheers	and	prolonged	standing	ovation.]

## Christine	Lagarde

## French	lawyer,	politician	and	economist

Christine	Lagarde	(1956-)	studied	English,	law	and	politics	in	France	and	began work	as	a	lawyer	in	Chicago,	USA	in	1981,	becoming	her	firm's	chairman	in 1999.	She	became	France's	trade	minister	in	2005	and	in	2007	the	country's	first female	finance	minister.	Since	July	2011,	she	has	been	the	managing	director	of the	International	Monetary	Fund	(IMF)	which	seeks	to	'foster	global	monetary cooperation,	secure	financial	stability,	facilitate	international	trade,	promote	high employment	and	sustainable	economic	growth,	and	reduce	poverty	around	the world'.	In	2014,	she	faced	a	charge	of	criminal	negligence	during	her	tenure	as finance	minister.	This	was	over	her	handling	of	a	€400	million	legal	battle between	the	tycoon	Bernard	Tapie	and	the	bank	Crédit	Lyonnais	over	the	sale	of the	sportswear	firm	Adidas.	In	July	2016,	a	French	court	confirmed	that	she must	stand	trial	in	relation	to	this	charge,	which	carries	a	possible	jail	sentence. In	2014,	she	was	named	in	Forbes	magazine	as	the	fifth	most	influential	woman in	the	world.
