## 'It	has	turned	out	to	be	an annus	horribilis'

24	November	1992,	London,	England

The	year	1992	should	have	been	an annus	mirabilis for	Queen	Elizabeth.	It was	the	40th	anniversary	of	her	accession,	and	the	previous	40	years	had seen	peace	and	increasing	prosperity	in	Britain	and	throughout	the Commonwealth.	However,	during	the	months	preceding	this	luncheon	at	the Guildhall	to	celebrate	the	anniversary,	she	had	suffered	many	harrowing moments.	One	of	these	-	the	fire	which	had	devastated	Windsor	Castle	-	had occurred	only	a	few	days	earlier,	on	20	November,	her	45th	wedding anniversary.	The	Queen	was	also	troubled	by	public	disquiet	over	statements that	the	government	would	pay	for	repairs	to	the	castle,	as	many	people considered	that	the	Queen,	as	a	wealthy	non-taxpayer,	should	take responsibility.	There	had	also	been	well-publicized	marital	problems	in	her immediate	family	during	the	previous	year.

The	City	of	London,	in	which	the	Guildhall	stands,	had	itself	experienced	a difficult	year.	An	IRA	bombing	in	April	1992	had	killed	three	people, destroyed	the	Baltic	Exchange	and	caused	widespread	damage	to surrounding	buildings,	and	the	Lloyd's	syndicates	had	suffered	their	worstever	trading	results.	It	was	a	troubled	period,	but	the	Queen	managed	to make	a	wryly	humorous	speech	in	which	she	reflected	on	cherished	moments of	the	preceding	40	years.

The	coming	months	were	also	to	be	difficult.	Two	days	after	giving	the speech,	the	Queen	bowed	to	the	inevitable	and	agreed	to	pay	tax	and	to	fund most	of	the	Royal	Family	herself,	removing	them	from	the	Civil	List.

My	Lord	Mayor: 1 	could	I	say,	first,	how	delighted	I	am	that	the	Lady Mayoress	is	here	today.

This	great	hall	has	provided	me	with	some	of	the	most	memorable	events	of	my life.	The	hospitality	of	the	City	of	London	is	famous	around	the	world,	but	now here	is	it	more	appreciated	than	among	the	members	of	my	family.	I	am	deeply grateful	that	you,	my	Lord	Mayor,	and	the	Corporation,	have	seen	fit	to	mark	the 40th	anniversary	of	my	accession	with	this	splendid	lunch,	and	by	giving	me	a picture	which	I	will	greatly	cherish.

Thank	you	also	for	inviting	representatives	of	so	many	organizations	with	which I	and	my	family	have	special	connections,	in	some	cases	stretching	back	over several	generations.	To	use	an	expression	more	common	north	of	the	Border, this	is	a	real	'gathering	of	the	clans'.

Nineteen-ninety-two	is	not	a	year	on	which	I	shall	look	back	with	undiluted pleasure.

In	the	words	of	one	of	my	more	sympathetic	correspondents,	it	has	turned	out	to be	an annus	horribilis .	I	suspect	that	I	am	not	alone	in	thinking	it	so.	Indeed,	I suspect	that	there	are	very	few	people	or	institutions	unaffected	by	these	last months	of	worldwide	turmoil	and	uncertainty. 2 	This	generosity	and	wholehearted	kindness	of	the	Corporation	of	the	City	to	Prince	Philip	and	me	would	be welcome	at	any	time,	but	at	this	particular	moment,	in	the	after	math	of	Friday's tragic	fire	at	Windsor,	it	is	especially	so.

And,	after	this	last	weekend,	we	appreciate	all	the	more	what	has	been	set	before us	today.	Years	of	experience,	however,	have	made	us	a	bit	more	canny	than	the lady,	less	well	versed	than	us	in	the	splendours	of	city	hospitality,	who,	when she	was	offered	a	balloon	glass	for	her	brandy,	asked	for	'only	half	a	glass, please'.

It	is	possible	to	have	too	much	of	a	good	thing.	A	well-meaning	bishop	was obviously	doing	his	best	when	he	told	Queen	Victoria,	'Ma'am,	we	cannot	pray too	often,	nor	too	fervently,	for	the	Royal	Family.'	The	Queen's	reply	was:	'Too fervently,	no;	too	often,	yes.'	I,	like	Queen	Victoria,	have	always	been	a	believer in	that	old	maxim	'moderation	in	all	things'.

I	sometimes	wonder	how	future	generations	will	judge	the	events	of	this tumultuous	year.	I	dare	say	that	history	will	take	a	slightly	more	moderate	view than	that	of	some	contemporary	commentators.	Distance	is	well	known	to	lend enchantment,	even	to	the	less	attractive	views.	After	all,	it	has	the	inestimable advantage	of	hindsight.

But	it	can	also	lend	an	extra	dimension	to	judgement,	giving	it	a	leavening	of moderation	and	compassion	-	even	of	wisdom	-	that	is	sometimes	lacking	in	the reactions	of	those	whose	task	it	is	in	life	to	offer	instant	opinions	on	all	things great	and	small.

No	section	of	the	community	has	all	the	virtues,	neither	does	any	have	all	the vices.

I	am	quite	sure	that	most	people	try	to	do	their	jobs	as	best	they	can,	even	if	the result	is	not	always	entirely	successful.	He	who	has	never	failed	to	reach perfection	has	a	right	to	be	the	harshest	critic.

There	can	be	no	doubt,	of	course,	that	criticism	is	good	for	people	and institutions	that	are	part	of	public	life.	No	institution	-	City,	monarchy,	whatever -	should	expect	to	be	free	from	the	scrutiny	of	those	who	give	it	their	loyalty	and support,	not	to	mention	those	who	don't.

But	we	are	all	part	of	the	same	fabric	of	our	national	society	and	that	scrutiny,	by one	part	of	another,	can	be	just	as	effective	if	it	is	made	with	a	touch	of gentleness,	good	humour	and	understanding.

This	sort	of	questioning	can	also	act,	and	it	should	do	so,	as	an	effective	engine for	change.

The	City	is	a	good	example	of	the	way	the	process	of	change	can	be incorporated	into	the	stability	and	continuity	of	a	great	institution.	I	particularly admire,	my	Lord	Mayor,	the	way	in	which	the	City	has	adapted	so	nimbly	to what	the Prayer	Book 3 calls	'the	changes	and	chances	of	this	mortal	life'.

You	have	set	an	example	of	how	it	is	possible	to	remain	effective	and	dynamic without	losing	those	indefinable	qualities,	style	and	character.	We	only	have	to look	around	this	great	hall	to	see	the	truth	of	that.

## Forty	years	is	quite	a	long	time.	I	am	glad	to	have	had the	chance	to	witness,	and	to	take	part	in,	many dramatic	changes	in	life	in	this	country.

But	I	am	glad	to	say	that	the	magnificent	standard	of	hospitality	given	on	so many	occasions	to	the	sovereign	by	the	Lord	Mayor	of	London	has	not	changed at	all.	It	is	an	outward	symbol	of	one	other	unchanging	factor	which	I	value above	all	-	the	loyalty	given	to	me	and	to	my	family	by	so	many	people	in	this country,	and	the	Commonwealth,	throughout	my	reign.

You,	my	Lord	Mayor,	and	all	those	whose	prayers	-	fervent,	I	hope,	but	not	too frequent	-	have	sustained	me	through	all	these	years,	are	friends	indeed.	Prince Philip	and	I	give	you	all,	wherever	you	may	be,	our	most	humble	thanks.

And	now	I	ask	you	to	rise	and	drink	the	health	of	the	Lord	Mayor	and Corporation	of	London.

Benazir Bhutto

## Benazir	Bhutto

## Pakistani	politician

After	the	military	coup	led	by	General	Mohammed	Zia	ul-Haq	-	in	which	her father,	the	former	prime	minister	Zulfikar	Ali	Bhutto,	was	executed	(1979)	Benazir	Bhutto	(1953-2007)	was	placed	under	house	arrest	at	frequent	intervals until	1984.	In	1988,	she	was	elected	prime	minister	after	the	death	of	Zia	in mysterious	circumstances,	becoming	the	first	modern-day	woman	leader	of	a Muslim	nation.	Over	the	following	nine	years	she	repeatedly	lost	and	regained power,	undermined	by	the	military	and	by	accusations	of	corruption.	Defeated	in the	1997	election,	she	was	later	sentenced	to	five	years'	imprisonment	for corruption,	disqualified	from	politics	and	sent	into	exile.	Having	reached	an agreement	with	President	Pervez	Musharraf,	she	finally	returned	to	Pakistan	in October	2007	and	prepared	to	fight	the	2008	general	elections	as	the	leading opposition	candidate.	She	was	assassinated	just	two	months	later,	on	27 December,	while	returning	from	an	election	rally	at	Rawalpindi.
