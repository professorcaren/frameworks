## 'Heroism	is	here,	in	the	hearts	of	so	many	of	our	fellow citizens'

12	January	2011,	McKale	Center,	University	of	Arizona,	Tucson

Barack	Obama's	power	as	a	political	orator	is	widely	recognized	and	has undoubtedly	played	a	significant	role	in	his	political	career.	A	measured	but impassioned	delivery,	combined	with	an	almost	lyrical	quality	often	present in	the	speechwriting,	have	resulted	in	masterly,	crowd-pleasing	oratory,	as seen	in	the	iconic	'Yes,	we	can'	New	Hampshire	primary	speech	of	January 2008.

This	speech	was	delivered	as	part	of	the	memorial	for	the	victims	of	the	2011 Tucson	shooting.	On	8	January	2011	US	Representative	Gabrielle	Giffords and	18	others	were	shot	by	Jared	Lee	Loughner	during	a	constituent	meeting held	in	a	supermarket	parking	lot	in	the	Tucson	suburb	Casas	Adobes.	Six people	died,	including	the	District	Court	Chief	Judge	John	Roll,	Gabe Zimmerman,	one	of	Giffords'	aides,	and	a	nine-year-old	girl,	ChristinaTaylor	Green.	The	primary	target,	Giffords,	who	was	shot	in	the	head	at point-blank	range,	survived	and	made	a	slow	recovery.	Loughner's motivation	was	unclear,	although	he	had	been	recently	diagnosed	with schizophrenia.

The	speech	was	written	by	Obama	in	collaboration	with	his	speechwriter Cody	Keenan	and	was	viewed	by	some	30	million	Americans	on	television. Its	dignity	and	restraint,	together	with	its	powerful	statement	of	the	value	of community	and	mutual	responsibility,	won	Obama	widespread	praise.

## Thank	you.	Please.	Please,	be	seated.

To	the	families	of	those	we've	lost,	to	all	who	called	them	friends,	to	the students	of	this	university,	the	public	servants	who	are	gathered	here,	the	people of	Tucson	and	the	people	of	Arizona:

## I	have	come	here	tonight	as	an	American	who,	like	all Americans,	kneels	to	pray	with	you	today	and	will	stand by	you	tomorrow.

There	is	nothing	I	can	say	that	will	fill	the	sudden	hole	torn	in	your	hearts.	But know	this:	the	hopes	of	a	nation	are	here	tonight.	We	mourn	with	you	for	the fallen.	We	join	you	in	your	grief.	And	we	add	our	faith	to	yours	that Representative	Gabrielle	Giffords 1 	and	the	other	living	victims	of	this	tragedy will	pull	through…

On	Saturday	morning,	Gabby,	her	staff,	and	many	of	her	constituents	gathered outside	a	supermarket	to	exercise	their	right	to	peaceful	assembly	and	free speech.

They	were	fulfilling	a	central	tenet	of	the	democracy	envisioned	by	our founders:	representatives	of	the	people	answering	questions	to	their	constituents, so	as	to	carry	their	concerns	back	to	our	nation's	capital.	Gabby	called	it

'Congress	on	Your	Corner,'	just	an	updated	version	of	government	of	and	by and	for	the	people.

And	that	quintessentially	American	scene,	that	was	the	scene	that	was	shattered by	a	gunman's	bullets.	And	the	six	people	who	lost	their	lives	on	Saturday:	they, too,	represented	what	is	best	in	us,	what	is	best	in	America.

Judge	John	Roll 2 	served	our	legal	system	for	nearly	40	years.

A	graduate	of	this	university	and	a	graduate	of	this	law	school,	Judge	Roll	was recommended	for	the	federal	bench	by	John	McCain	20	years	ago,	appointed	by President	George	H	W	Bush,	and	rose	to	become	Arizona's	chief	federal judge…John	is	survived	by	his	loving	wife,	Maureen,	his	three	sons,	and	his	five beautiful	grandchildren.

George	and	Dorothy	Morris	-	'Dot'	to	her	friends	-	were	high	school sweethearts	who	got	married	and	had	two	daughters.	They	did	everything together,	traveling	the	open	road	in	their	R.V.,	enjoying	what	their	friends	called a	50-year	honeymoon.

Saturday	morning,	they	went	by	the	Safeway	to	hear	what	their	congresswoman had	to	say.	When	gunfire	rang	out,	George,	a	former	marine,	instinctively	tried to	shield	his	wife.

Both	were	shot.	Dot	passed	away.

A	New	Jersey	native,	Phyllis	Schneck	retired	to	Tucson	to	beat	the	snow.	But	in the	summer,	she	would	return	east,	where	her	world	revolved	around	her	three children,	her	seven	grandchildren,	and	two-year-old	great-granddaughter…A Republican,	she	took	a	liking	to	Gabby	and	wanted	to	get	to	know	her	better.

Dorwan	and	Mavy	Stoddard	grew	up	in	Tucson	together	about	70	years	ago. They	moved	apart	and	started	their	own	respective	families,	but	after	both	were widowed,	they	found	their	way	back	here,	to,	as	one	of	Mavy's	daughters	put	it, 'be	boyfriend	and	girlfriend	again'…His	final	act	of	selflessness	was	to	dive	on top	of	his	wife,	sacrificing	his	life	for	hers.

Everything	-	everything	Gabe	Zimmerman 3 	did,	he	did	with	passion,	but	his	true passion	was	helping	people.	As	Gabby's	outreach	director,	he	made	the	cares	of thousands	of	her	constituents	his	own,	seeing	to	it	that	seniors	got	the	Medicare 4 benefits	that	they	had	earned,	that	veterans	got	the	medals	and	the	care	that	they deserved,	that	government	was	working	for	ordinary	folks…

And	then	there	is	nine-year-old	Christina-Taylor	Green.	Christina	was	an	A student…She	showed	an	appreciation	for	life	uncommon	for	a	girl	her	age. She'd	remind	her	mother,	'We	are	so	blessed.	We	have	the	best	life.'	And	she'd pay	those	blessings	back	by	participating	in	a	charity	that	helped	children	who were	less	fortunate…

Our	hearts	are	full	of	hope	and	thanks	for	the	13	Americans	who	survived	the shooting,	including	the	congresswoman	many	of	them	went	to	see	on	Saturday.

I	have	just	come	from	the	University	Medical	Center,	just	a	mile	from	here, where	our	friend	Gabby	courageously	fights	to	recover	even	as	we	speak.

And	I	want	to	tell	you	-	her	husband,	Mark,	is	here,	and	he	allows	me	to	share this	with	you.	Right	after	we	went	to	visit,	a	few	minutes	after	we	left	her	room and	some	of	her	colleagues	from	Congress	were	in	the	room,	Gabby	opened	her eyes	for	the	first	time.

Gabby	opened	her	eyes	for	the	first	time.

Gabby	opened	her	eyes.

Gabby	opened	her	eyes,	so	I	can	tell	you,	she	knows	we	are	here,	she	knows	we love	her,	and	she	knows	that	we	are	rooting	for	her	through	what	is	undoubtedly going	to	be	a	difficult	journey.	We	are	there	for	her.

Our	hearts	are	full	of	thanks	for	that	good	news,	and	our	hearts	are	full	of gratitude	for	those	who	saved	others.

We	are	grateful	to	Daniel	Hernandez,	a	volunteer	in	Gabby's	office.	And	Daniel, I'm	sorry,	you	may	deny	it,	but	we've	decided	you	are	a	hero,	because	you	ran through	the	chaos	to	minister	to	your	boss	and	tended	to	her	wounds	and	help keep	her	alive.

We	are	grateful	to	the	men	who	tackled	the	gunman	as	he	stopped	to	reload.

They're	right	over	there.

We	-	we	are	grateful	for	petite	Patricia	Maisch,	who	wrestled	away	the	killer's ammunition	and	undoubtedly	saved	some	lives.

And	we	are	grateful	for	the	doctors	and	nurses	and	first	responders 5 	who	worked wonders	to	heal	those	who'd	been	hurt.	We	are	grateful	to	them.

These	men	and	women	remind	us	that	heroism	is	found	not	only	on	the	fields	of battle.	They	remind	us	that	heroism	does	not	require	special	training	or	physical strength.	Heroism	is	here,	in	the	hearts	of	so	many	of	our	fellow	citizens,	all around	us,	just	waiting	to	be	summoned,	as	it	was	on	Saturday	morning…

Already,	we've	seen	a	national	conversation	commence,	not	only	about	the motivations	behind	these	killings,	but	about	everything	from	the	merits	of	gun safety	laws 6 to	the	adequacy	of	our	mental	health	system.	And	much	-	much	of this	process	of	debating	what	might	be	done	to	prevent	such	tragedies	in	the future	is	an	essential	ingredient	in	our	exercise	of	self-government.

But	at	a	time	when	our	discourse	has	become	so	sharply	polarized,	at	a	time when	we	are	far	too	eager	to	lay	the	blame	for	all	that	ails	the	world	at	the	feet	of those	who	happen	to	think	differently	than	we	do,	it's	important	for	us	to	pause for	a	moment	and	make	sure	that	we're	talking	with	each	other	in	a	way	that	that	heals,	not	in	a	way	that	wounds…

Bad	things	happen,	and	we	have	to	guard	against	simple	explanations	in	the aftermath.

For	the	truth	is,	none	of	us	can	know	exactly	what	triggered	this	vicious	attack. None	of	us	can	know	with	any	certainty	what	might	have	stopped	these	shots from	being	fired	or	what	thoughts	lurked	in	the	inner	recesses	of	a	violent	man's mind.

Yes,	we	have	to	examine	all	the	facts	behind	this	tragedy.	We	cannot	and	will not	be	passive	in	the	face	of	such	violence.	We	should	be	willing	to	challenge old	assumptions	in	order	to	lessen	the	prospects	of	such	violence	in	the	future.

But	what	we	cannot	do	is	use	this	tragedy	as	one	more	occasion	to	turn	on	each other.

That	we	cannot	do.

That	we	cannot	do.

As	we	discuss	these	issues,	let	each	of	us	do	so	with	a	good	dose	of	humility. Rather	than	pointing	fingers	or	assigning	blame,	let's	use	this	occasion	to	expand our	moral	imaginations,	to	listen	to	each	other	more	carefully,	to	sharpen	our instincts	for	empathy,	and	remind	ourselves	of	all	the	ways	that	our	hopes	and dreams	are	bound	together.	After	all,	that's	what	most	of	us	do	when	we	lose somebody	in	our	family,	especially	if	the	loss	is	unexpected.	We're	shaken	out of	our	routines.	We're	forced	to	look	inward.	We	reflect	on	the	past…

So	sudden	loss	causes	us	to	look	backward,	but	it	also	forces	us	to	look	forward, to	reflect	on	the	present	and	the	future,	on	the	manner	in	which	we	live	our	lives and	nurture	our	relationships	with	those	who	are	still	with	us.

We	may	ask	ourselves	if	we've	shown	enough	kindness	and	generosity	and compassion	to	the	people	in	our	lives.	Perhaps	we	question	whether	we're	doing right	by	our	children,	or	our	community,	whether	our	priorities	are	in	order.	We recognize	our	own	mortality.	And	we	are	reminded	that,	in	the	fleeting	time	we have	on	this	Earth,	what	matters	is	not	wealth,	or	status,	or	power,	or	fame,	but rather	how	well	we	have	loved	and	what	small	part	we	have	played	in	making the	lives	of	other	people	better.

And	that	process	-	that	process	of	reflection,	of	making	sure	we	align	our	values with	our	actions…that,	I	believe,	is	what	a	tragedy	like	this	requires…

If	this	tragedy	prompts	reflection	and	debate,	as	it	should,	let's	make	sure	it's worthy	of	those	we	have	lost.

Let's	make	sure	it's	not	on	the	usual	plane	of	politics	and	point-scoring	and pettiness	that	drifts	away	in	the	next	news	cycle.

The	loss	of	these	wonderful	people	should	make	every	one	of	us	strive	to	be better,	to	be	better	in	our	private	lives,	to	be	better	friends	and	neighbors	and	coworkers	and	parents.

And	if,	as	has	been	discussed	in	recent	days,	their	death	helps	usher	in	more civility	in	our	public	discourse,	let	us	remember	it	is	not	because	a	simple	lack	of civility	caused	this	tragedy	-	it	did	not	-	but	rather	because	only	a	more	civil	and honest	public	discourse	can	help	us	face	up	to	the	challenges	of	our	nation	in	a way	that	would	make	them	proud.

We	should	be	civil	because	we	want	to	live	up	to	the	example	of	public	servants like	John	Roll	and	Gabby	Giffords,	who	knew	first	and	foremost	that	we	are	all Americans,	and	that	we	can	question	each	other's	ideas	without	questioning	each other's	love	of	country,	and	that

…our	task,	working	together,	is	to	constantly	widen	the circle	of	our	concern,	so	that	we	bequeath	the	American dream	to	future	generations.

They	believe	-	they	believe	and	I	believe	that	we	can	be	better.	Those	who	died here,	those	who	saved	lives	here,	they	help	me	believe.	We	may	not	be	able	to stop	all	evil	in	the	world,	but	I	know	that	how	we	treat	one	another,	that's entirely	up	to	us.

And	I	believe	that,	for	all	our	imperfections,	we	are	full	of	decency	and	goodness and	that	the	forces	that	divide	us	are	not	as	strong	as	those	that	unite	us.

That's	what	I	believe,	in	part	because	that's	what	a	child	like	Christina-Taylor Green	believed.

Imagine	-	can	you	imagine	for	a	moment?	-	here	was	a	young	girl	who	was	just becoming	aware	of	our	democracy,	just	beginning	to	understand	the	obligations of	citizenship,	just	starting	to	glimpse	the	fact	that	someday	she,	too,	might	play a	part	in	shaping	her	nation's	future.

She	had	been	elected	to	her	student	council.	She	saw	public	service	as	something exciting	and	hopeful.	She	was	off	to	meet	her	congresswoman,	someone	she	was sure	was	good	and	important	and	might	be	a	role	model.	She	saw	all	this	through the	eyes	of	a	child,	undimmed	by	the	cynicism	or	vitriol	that	we	adults	all	too often	just	take	for	granted.

I	want	us	to	live	up	to	her	expectations.

I	want	our	democracy	to	be	as	good	as	Christina	imagined	it…

- …Christina	was	given	to	us	on	September	11th,	2001,	one	of	50	babies	born	that day	to	be	pictured	in	a	book	called Faces	of	Hope . 7 On	either	side	of	her	photo	in that	book	were	simple	wishes	for	a	child's	life:	'I	hope	you	help	those	in	need,' read	one.	'I	hope	you	know	all	of	the	words	to	the	National	Anthem	and	sing	it with	your	hand	over	your	heart.	I	hope	-	I	hope	you	jump	in	rain	puddles.'

## If	there	are	rain	puddles	in	Heaven,	Christina	is jumping	in	them	today.

And	here	on	this	Earth,	here	on	this	Earth,	we	place	our	hands	over	our	hearts and	we	commit	ourselves	as	Americans	to	forging	a	country	that	is	forever worthy	of	her	gentle,	happy	spirit.

May	God	bless	and	keep	those	we've	lost	in	restful	and	eternal	peace.	May	he love	and	watch	over	the	survivors.	And	may	he	bless	the	United	States	of America.

San Suu Kyi Aung

## Aung	San	Suu	Kyi

Burmese	political	leader

Aung	San	Suu	Kyi	(1945-)	was	the	daughter	of	the	nationalist	hero	General Aung	San	(1915-47),	who	led	Burma's	fight	for	independence	until	his assassination	a	few	months	before	it	was	achieved.	She	began	her	career	as	an academic,	eventually	settling	in	Oxford,	UK,	with	her	British	husband,	Michael Aris	(1946-99).	In	1988,	she	returned	to	Burma,	which	was	in	a	state	of	extreme political	unrest	under	a	new	military	junta,	and	helped	found	the	National League	for	Democracy	(NLD),	becoming	its	general	secretary.	Over	the following	two	decades,	despite	winning	wide	popular	support,	both	at	home	and abroad,	she	was	subjected	to	long	periods	of	house	arrest.	She	was	finally released	on	13	November	2010,	and	in	2012	the	NLD	successfully	contested	that year's	by-elections,	with	Suu	Kyi	assuming	a	seat	in	the	lower	house	of	the Burmese	Parliament	and	the	position	of	Leader	of	the	Opposition.	In	2012,	she announced	her	candidacy	for	the	presidential	elections	of	2015.	The	NLD	won	a clear	majority,	but	under	the	constitution	of	2008	Suu	Kyi	was	barred	from becoming	president	as	the	widow	and	mother	of	foreigners.	Instead,	she	assumed a	number	of	key	ministerial	positions	and	was	appointed	by	President	Htin	Kyaw as	state	counsellor	-	a	post	equivalent	to	prime	minister.
