## 'Security	through	national	armament	is…a	disastrous illusion'

19	February	1950,	television	broadcast	from	Princeton,	New	Jersey,	USA

Between	1941	and	1962,	Eleanor	Roosevelt	hosted	various	radio	and television	shows.	These	included	a	programme	during	which	Einstein,	then 71,	discussed	the	issue	of	nuclear	security.

Einstein	had	written	his	famous	letter	to	her	late	husband,	President Roosevelt,	in	August	1939.	Recent	research	in	France	and	America,	it explained,	meant	'it	may	become	possible	to	set	up	a	nuclear	chain	reaction in	a	large	mass	of	uranium,	by	which	vast	amounts	of	power…would	be generated'.	The	letter	continued:	'This	new	phenomenon	would	also	lead	to the	construction	of	bombs.'	Einstein	had	recommended	that	the	US government	maintain	permanent	contact	with	the	physicists	working	in	that field,	urged	funding	to	facilitate	progress	and	warned	of	evidence	that German	scientists	were	exploring	the	same	area	of	research.

Einstein's	letter	had	prompted	Roosevelt	to	support	American	nuclear scientists.	Their	work,	which	became	known	as	the	Manhattan	Project,	led	to development	of	the	bombs	that	were	dropped	on	Japan	in	August	1945. Einstein	was	appalled	and	later	remarked,	'I	could	burn	my	fingers	that	I wrote	that	first	letter	to	Roosevelt.'	He	spent	much	of	his	remaining	ten	years campaigning	for	international	control	of	nuclear	arms.

Though	Einstein	was	a	popular	figure,	with	a	playful	public	profile,	his pacifism	and	socialism	-	the	latter	expressed	in	a	famous	essay	of	1949	-	led to	his	investigation	by	the	Federal	Bureau	of	Investigation.	This	did	not discourage	the	liberal-minded	Mrs	Roosevelt	from	allowing	him	a	platform for	his	views.

I	am	grateful	to	you	for	the	opportunity	to	express	my	conviction	in	this	most important	political	question.

The	idea	of	achieving	security	through	national	armament	is,	at	the	present	state of	military	technique,	a	disastrous	illusion.	On	the	part	of	the	United	States,	this illusion	has	been	particularly	fostered	by	the	fact	that	this	country	succeeded	first in	producing	an	atomic	bomb.

The	belief	seemed	to	prevail	that	in	the	end	it	were	possible	to	achieve	decisive military	superiority.

In	this	way,	any	potential	opponent	would	be	intimidated,	and	security,	so ardently	desired	by	all	of	us,	brought	to	us	and	all	of	humanity.	The	maxim which	we	have	been	following	during	these	last	five	years	has	been,	in	short: security	through	superior	military	power,	whatever	the	cost.

This	mechanistic,	technical-military	psychological	attitude	had	inevitable consequences.	Every	single	act	in	foreign	policy	is	governed	exclusively	by	one viewpoint:	how	do	we	have	to	act	in	order	to	achieve	utmost	superiority	over	the opponent	in	case	of	war?	Establishing	military	bases	at	all	possible	strategically important	points	on	the	globe.	Arming	and	economic	strengthening	of	potential allies.

Within	the	country:	concentration	of	tremendous	financial	power	in	the	hands	of the	military,	militarization	of	the	youth,	close	supervision	of	the	loyalty	of	the citizens	-	in	particular,	of	the	civil	servants	-	by	a	police	force	growing	more conspicuous	every	day.	Intimidation	of	people	of	independent	political	thinking. 1

Indoctrination	of	the	public	by	radio,	press,	school.	Growing	restriction	of	the range	of	public	information	under	the	pressure	of	military	secrecy.

The	armament	race	between	the	USA	and	the	USSR,	originally	supposed	to	be	a preventive	measure,	assumes	a	hysterical	character.

## On	both	sides,	the	means	to	mass	destruction	are perfected	with	feverish	haste,	behind	the	respective walls	of	secrecy.

The	H-bomb 2 	appears	on	the	public	horizon	as	a	probably	attainable	goal.	Its accelerated	development	has	been	solemnly	proclaimed	by	the	President. 3

If	successful,	radioactive	poisoning	of	the	atmosphere	and	hence	annihilation	of any	life	on	Earth	has	been	brought	within	the	range	of	technical	possibilities. The	ghost-like	character	of	this	development	lies	in	its	apparently	compulsory trend.	Every	step	appears	as	the	unavoidable	consequence	of	the	preceding	one.

In	the	end,	there	beckons	more	and	more	clearly	general	annihilation.

Is	there	any	way	out	of	this	impasse	created	by	man	himself?	All	of	us,	and particularly	those	who	are	responsible	for	the	attitude	of	the	US	and	the	USSR, should	realize	that	we	may	have	vanquished	an	external	enemy, 4 	but	have	been incapable	of	getting	rid	of	the	mentality	created	by	the	war.

It	is	impossible	to	achieve	peace	as	long	as	every	single	action	is	taken	with	a possible	future	conflict	in	view.	The	leading	point	of	view	of	all	political	action should	therefore	be:	What	can	we	do	to	bring	about	a	peaceful	co-existence	and even	loyal	co-operation	of	the	nations?

The	first	problem	is	to	do	away	with	mutual	fear	and	distrust.

Solemn	renunciation	of	violence	(not	only	with	respect	to	means	of	mass destruction)	is	undoubtedly	necessary.

Such	renunciation,	however,	can	only	be	effective	if	at	the	same	time	a	supranational	judicial	and	executive	body	is	set	up,	empowered	to	decide	questions	of immediate	concern	to	the	security	of	the	nations.	Even	a	declaration	of	the nations	to	collaborate	loyally	in	the	realization	of	such	a	'restricted	world government'	would	considerably	reduce	the	imminent	danger	of	war.

In	the	last	analysis,	every	kind	of	peaceful	co-operation	among	men	is	primarily based	on	mutual	trust	and	only	secondly	on	institutions	such	as	courts	of	justice and	police.	This	holds	for	nations	as	well	as	for	individuals.	And	the	basis	of trust	is	loyal	give	and	take.

## Nikita	Khrushchev

Russian	politician

A	former	shepherd	boy	and	locksmith,	Nikita	Sergeyevich	Khrushchev	(18941971)	joined	the	Bolshevik	Party	in	1918	and	rose	rapidly	in	the	party organization.	In	1953,	on	the	death	of	Joseph	Stalin,	he	became	First	Secretary of	the	All	Union	Party.	Among	the	events	of	his	administration	were	the	1956 Poznań	riots,	which	he	quelled,	the	Hungarian	Uprising	of	1956,	which	he crushed,	and	the	failed	attempt	to	install	missiles	in	Cuba	(1962).	Khrushchev did	much	to	enhance	the	ambitions	and	status	of	the	USSR	abroad	but	was nevertheless	deposed	in	1964.
