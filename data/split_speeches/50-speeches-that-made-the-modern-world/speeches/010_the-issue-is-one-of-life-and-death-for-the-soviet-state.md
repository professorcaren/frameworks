## 'The	issue	is	one	of	life	and	death	for	the	Soviet	state'

3	July	1941,	radio	broadcast	from	Moscow,	Russia

The	USSR	was	ill-prepared	for	the	German	invasion	of	June	1941,	codenamed	Operation	Barbarossa	after	a	12th-century	Holy	Roman	Emperor. Despite	the	non-aggression	pact	of	1939	-	which	included	plans	to	divide	up the	countries	of	eastern	Europe	-	Stalin	had	foreseen	the	possibility	of German	aggression,	but	did	not	expect	it	as	soon	as	this.

The	USSR's	Red	Army	was	well	armed	and	plentiful	in	numbers	-	giving rise	to	some	complacency	-	but	its	troops	lacked	training	and communications	equipment.	Moreover,	many	of	its	most	experienced officers	and	strategists	had	been	killed	or	imprisoned	during	Stalin's ideological	purges	of	1936-8,	and	those	who	remained	tended	to	tell	him what	he	wanted	to	hear.	Their	German	adversaries,	meanwhile,	were supremely	well	drilled	and	confident,	having	conquered	much	of	Europe. The	Luftwaffe	-	far	better	equipped	than	the	Soviet	air	force	-	and	Panzer tank	divisions	swiftly	decimated	Soviet	positions.

This	radio	address,	given	less	than	two	weeks	after	the	invasion,	was	an effective	morale-booster,	employing	familiar	martial	slogans	such	as 'Forward	to	victory!'.	Its	fiery	rhetoric	fuels	faith	in	the	Soviet	forces, encourages	civilians	to	participate	in	the	fray	and	incites	hatred	for	the invaders.

But	it	was	not	enough	to	forestall	the	rapid	advance	of	German	forces.	By August	1941,	they	had	reached	the	outskirts	of	Leningrad,	which	was	under siege	for	900	days.	The	Germans	were	eventually	halted	in	November,	after failing	to	take	Moscow.	A	long	and	bitter	struggle	ensued,	with	heavy	losses both	to	the	combatants	and	to	civilians.

Comrades,	citizens,	brothers	and	sisters,	men	of	our	Army	and	Navy:	my words	are	addressed	to	you,	dear	friends!

The	perfidious	attack	by	Hitlerite	Germany	on	our	fatherland,	begun	on	22	June, is	continuing.

In	spite	of	the	heroic	resistance	of	the	Red	Army,	and	although	the	enemy's finest	divisions	and	finest	air	force	units	have	already	been	smashed	and	have met	their	doom	on	the	field	of	battle,	the	enemy	continues	to	push	forward, hurling	fresh	forces	to	the	front…

How	could	it	have	happened	that	our	glorious	Red	Army	surrendered	a	number of	our	cities	and	districts	to	the	fascist	armies?	Is	it	really	true	that	the	Germanfascist	troops	are	invincible,	as	the	braggart	fascist	propagandists	are	ceaselessly blaring	forth?

Of	course	not!	History	shows	that	there	are	no	invincible	armies	and	never	have been.	Napoleon's	army	was	considered	invincible,	but	it	was	beaten	successively by	the	armies	of	Russia,	England	and	Germany.	Kaiser	Wilhelm's	German	army in	the	period	of	the	First	Imperialist	War	was	also	considered	invincible,	but	it was	beaten	several	times	by	Russian	and	Anglo-French	troops,	and	was	finally smashed	by	the	Anglo-French	forces.	The	same	must	be	said	of	Hitler's German-fascist	army	of	today.

This	army	had	not	yet	met	with	serious	resistance	on	the	continent	of	Europe. Only	on	our	territory	has	it	met	with	serious	resistance.	And	if,	as	a	result	of	this resistance,	the	finest	divisions	of	Hitler's	German-fascist	army	have	been defeated	by	our	Red	Army,	this	means	that	it	too	can	be	smashed	and	will	be smashed,	as	were	the	armies	of	Napoleon	and	Wilhelm…

It	may	be	asked,	how	could	the	Soviet	government	have	consented	to	conclude	a non-aggression	pact	with	such	perfidious	people,	such	fiends	as	Hitler	and Ribbentrop? 1

Was	this	not	an	error	on	the	part	of	the	Soviet	government?	Of	course	not!

Non-aggression	pacts	are	pacts	of	peace	between	two	states.	It	was	such	a	pact that	Germany	proposed	to	us	in	1939.	Could	the	Soviet	government	have declined	such	a	proposal?	I	think	that	not	a	single	peace-loving	state	could decline	a	peace	treaty	with	a	neighbouring	state,	even	though	the	latter	were headed	by	such	monsters	and	cannibals	as	Hitler	and	Ribbentrop.	But	that,	of course,	only	on	the	one	indispensable	condition	-	that	this	peace	treaty	did	not jeopardize,	either	directly	or	indirectly,	the	territorial	integrity,	independence	and honour	of	the	peace-loving	state.	As	is	well	known,	the	non-aggression	pact between	Germany	and	the	USSR	was	precisely	such	a	pact…

What	has	fascist	Germany	gained	and	what	has	she	lost	by	perfidiously	tearing up	the	pact	and	attacking	the	USSR?	She	has	gained	a	certain	advantageous position	for	her	troops	for	a	short	period	of	time,	but	she	has	lost	politically	by exposing	herself	in	the	eyes	of	the	entire	world	as	a	bloodthirsty	aggressor. There	can	be	no	doubt	that	this	short-lived	military	gain	for	Germany	is	only	an episode,	while	the	tremendous	political	gain	of	the	USSR	is	a	weighty	and lasting	factor	that	is	bound	to	form	the	basis	for	the	development	of	outstanding military	successes	of	the	Red	Army	in	the	war	with	fascist	Germany.

That	is	why	the	whole	of	our	valiant	Red	Army,	the	whole	of	our	valiant	Navy, all	the	falcons	of	our	Air	Force,	all	the	peoples	of	our	country,	all	the	finest	men and	women	of	Europe,	America	and	Asia,	and,	finally,	all	the	finest	men	and women	of	Germany	-	denounce	the	treacherous	acts	of	the	German-fascists, sympathize	with	the	Soviet	government,	approve	of	its	conduct,	and	see	that	ours is	a	just	cause,	that	the	enemy	will	be	defeated,	and	that	we	are	bound	to	win…

The	enemy	is	cruel	and	implacable.

He	is	out	to	seize	our	lands,	watered	by	the	sweat	of	our	brows,	to	seize	our grain	and	oil	secured	by	the	labour	of	our	hands.	He	is	out	to	restore	the	rule	of the	landlords,	to	restore	Tsarism,	to	destroy	the	national	culture	and	the	existence as	states	of	the	Russians,	Ukrainians,	Byelorussians,	Lithuanians,	Latvians, Estonians,	Uzbeks,	Tatars,	Moldavians,	Georgians,	Armenians,	Azerbaijanians and	the	other	free	peoples	of	the	Soviet	Union,	to	Germanize	them,	to	turn	them into	the	slaves	of	German	princes	and	barons.

Thus	the	issue	is	one	of	life	and	death	for	the	Soviet	state,	of	life	and	death	for the	peoples	of	the	USSR;

## …the	issue	is	whether	the	peoples	of	the	Soviet	Union shall	be	free	or	fall	into	slavery.

The	Soviet	people	must	realize	this	and	abandon	all	complacency;	they	must mobilize	themselves	and	reorganize	all	their	work	on	a	new,	war-time	footing, where	there	can	be	no	mercy	to	the	enemy…

All	our	work	must	be	immediately	reorganized	on	a	war	footing;	everything must	be	subordinated	to	the	interests	of	the	front	and	the	task	of	organizing	the destruction	of	the	enemy.

The	peoples	of	the	Soviet	Union	now	see	that	German	fascism	is	untameable	in its	savage	fury	and	hatred	of	our	native	country,	which	has	ensured	all	its working	people	labour	in	freedom	and	prosperity.	The	peoples	of	the	Soviet Union	must	risk	against	the	enemy	and	defend	their	rights	and	their	land.

The	Red	Army,	Red	Navy	and	all	citizens	of	the	Soviet	Union	must	defend every	inch	of	Soviet	soil,	must	fight	to	the	last	drop	of	blood	for	our	towns	and villages,	must	display	the	daring,	initiative	and	mental	alertness	that	are	inherent in	our	people…

In	areas	occupied	by	the	enemy,	guerrilla	units,	mounted	and	on	foot,	must	be formed;	sabotage	groups	must	be	organized	to	combat	enemy	units,	to	foment guerrilla	warfare	everywhere,	blow	up	bridges	and	roads,	damage	telephone	and telegraph	lines,	set	fire	to	forests,	stores	and	transports.	In	occupied	regions conditions	must	be	made	unbearable	for	the	enemy	and	all	his	accomplices. They	must	be	hounded	and	annihilated	at	every	step,	and	all	their	measures frustrated.

The	war	with	fascist	Germany	cannot	be	considered	an	ordinary	war.

It	is	not	only	a	war	between	two	armies,	it	is	also	a	great	war	of	the	entire	Soviet people	against	the	German-fascist	armies.	The	aim	of	this	national	patriotic	war in	defence	of	our	country	against	the	fascist	oppressors	is	not	only	to	eliminate the	danger	hanging	over	our	country,	but	also	to	aid	all	the	European	peoples groaning	under	the	yoke	of	German	fascism…

Comrades,	our	forces	are	numberless.	The	overweening	enemy	will	soon	learn this	to	his	cost.	Side	by	side	with	the	Red	Army,	many	thousands	of	workers, collective	farmers	and	intellectuals	are	rising	to	fight	the	enemy	aggressor.	The masses	of	our	people	will	rise	up	in	their	millions.	The	working	people	of Moscow	and	Leningrad	have	already	begun	to	form	huge	People's	Guards	in support	of	the	Red	Army.	Such	People's	Guards	must	be	raised	in	every	city which	is	in	danger	of	enemy	invasion;

## …all	the	working	people	must	be	roused	to	defend	with their	lives	their	freedom,	their	honour	and	their	country in	this	patriotic	war	against	German	fascism.

In	order	to	ensure	the	rapid	mobilization	of	all	the	forces	of	the	peoples	of	the USSR	and	to	repulse	the	enemy	who	has	treacherously	attacked	our	country,	a State	Committee	of	Defence	has	been	formed	and	the	entire	state	authority	has now	been	vested	in	it.	The	State	Committee	of	Defence	has	entered	on	the performance	of	its	functions	and	calls	upon	all	our	people	to	rally	around	the party	of	Lenin	and	Stalin	and	around	the	Soviet	government,	so	as	to	render	selfsacrificing	support	to	the	Red	Army	and	Red	Navy,	to	exterminate	the	enemy and	secure	victory.

All	our	forces	for	the	support	of	our	heroic	Red	Army	and	our	glorious	Red Navy!	All	the	forces	of	the	people	for	the	destruction	of	the	enemy!	Forward	to victory!

## German	politician

Paul	Joseph	Goebbels	(1897-1945)	was	an	enthusiastic	supporter	of	Adolf	Hitler and	joined	the	Nazi	Party	in	1924.	With	Hitler's	accession	to	power,	'Jupp'	was made	head	of	the	Ministry	of	Public	Enlightenment	and	Propaganda.	A	bitter anti-Semite,	he	had	a	gift	for	mob	oratory	which	made	him	a	powerful	exponent of	the	more	radical	aspects	of	the	Nazi	philosophy.	He	retained	Hitler's confidence	to	the	last.	In	the	Berlin	bunker	where	Hitler	spent	his	final	days, Goebbels	and	his	wife,	Magda,	committed	suicide	after	they	had	taken	the	lives of	their	six	children.
