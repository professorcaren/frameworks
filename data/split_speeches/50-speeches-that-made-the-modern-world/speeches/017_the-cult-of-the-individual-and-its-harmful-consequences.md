## 'The	cult	of	the	individual	and	its	harmful

## consequences'

25	February	1956,	Moscow,	Russia

Khrushchev's	famous	denouncement	of	Stalin	was	made	in	a	closed,	latenight	session	at	the	20th	Congress	of	the	Communist	Party	of	the	Soviet Union,	the	first	to	be	held	since	Stalin's	death	in	1953.

Just	over	a	year	earlier,	the	Shvernik	Commission	had	been	established	under the	leadership	of	Nikolai	Shvernik,	who	had	been	nominal	head	of	state during	the	Stalin	era.	Its	remit	was	to	investigate	repression	under	Stalin,	and in	particular	the	'Great	Purge'	of	1937-8,	during	which	at	least	1.5	million party	members	were	arrested,	many	were	tortured	and	some	680,000	were executed.

Though	Shvernik's	report	was	not	made	public,	Khrushchev	drew	on	its findings	extensively	while	preparing	this	speech.	In	it,	he	focuses	on	several areas:	Stalin's	departures	from	the	principles	of	Marxism-Leninism;	his reliance	on	a	terrifying	police	state;	and	his	vanity:	the	'cult	of	personality' was	later	used	as	a	euphemistic	umbrella	term	to	refer	to	all	Stalin's	crimes.

The	speech	lasted	over	three	hours:	highlights	are	given	here.	Despite	the secrecy,	it	soon	leaked	to	other	Eastern	Bloc	countries,	paving	the	way	for reconciliation	with	Marshal	Josip	Tito	and	his	Yugoslavian	communists	in June.

Before	long	it	reached	the	West	-	possibly	with	the	tacit	assent	of	the	Soviet authorities	-	appearing	in	an	American	newspaper	later	the	same	year.	It	was not	officially	published	in	Russia	until	1989.	The	West's	relationship	with Khrushchev	was	often	troubled,	but	this	speech	is	now	seen	as	a	turning point	in	the	liberalization	of	eastern	Europe.

Russian	Comrades…a	lot	has	been	said	about	the	cult	of	the	individual	and about	its	harmful	consequences.

After	Stalin's	death,	the	central	committee	of	the	party	began	to	implement	a policy	of	explaining	concisely	and	consistently	that	it	is	impermissible	and foreign	to	the	spirit	of	Marxism-Leninism 1 	to	elevate	one	person,	to	transform him	into	a	superman,	possessing	supernatural	characteristics	akin	to	those	of	a god.	Such	a	man	supposedly	knows	everything,	sees	everything,	thinks	for everyone,	can	do	anything,	is	infallible	in	his	behaviour.

Such	a	belief	about	a	man	-	and	specifically	about	Stalin	-	was	cultivated	among us	for	many	years.	The	objective	of	the	present	report	is	not	a	thorough evaluation	of	Stalin's	life	and	activity.	Concerning	Stalin's	merits,	an	entirely sufficient	number	of	books,	pamphlets	and	studies	had	already	been	written	in his	lifetime.	The	role	of	Stalin	in	the	preparation	and	execution	of	the	socialist revolution,	in	the	civil	war	and	in	the	fight	for	the	construction	of	socialism	in our	country	is	universally	known.	Everyone	knows	it	well.

At	present,	we	are	concerned	with	a	question	which	has	immense	importance	for the	party	now	and	for	the	future	-	with	how	the	cult	of	the	person	of	Stalin	has been	gradually	growing,	the	cult	which	became	at	a	certain	specific	stage	the source	of	a	whole	series	of	exceedingly	serious	and	grave	perversions	of	party principles,	of	party	democracy,	of	revolutionary	legality…

The	great	modesty	of	the	genius	of	the	revolution,	Vladimir	Ilich	Lenin,	is known.	Lenin	had	always	stressed	the	role	of	the	people	as	the	creator	of	history, the	directing	and	organizational	role	of	the	party	as	a	living	and	creative organism,	and	also	the	role	of	the	central	committee…

Always	unyielding	in	matters	of	principle,	Lenin	never	imposed	by	force	his views	upon	his	co-workers.	He	tried	to	convince;	he	patiently	explained	his opinions	to	others.	Lenin	always	diligently	observed	that	the	norms	of	party	life were	realized,	that	the	party	statute	was	enforced,	that	the	party	congresses	and the	plenary	sessions	of	the	central	committee	took	place	at	the	proper	intervals.

In	addition	to	the	great	accomplishments	of	V	I	Lenin	for	the	victory	of	the working	class	and	of	the	working	peasants,	for	the	victory	of	our	party	and	for the	application	of	the	ideas	of	scientific	communism	to	life,	his	acute	mind expressed	itself	also	in	this:	that	he	detected	in	Stalin	in	time	those	negative characteristics	which	resulted	later	in	grave	consequences…

As	later	events	have	proven,	Lenin's	anxiety	was	justified.	In	the	first	period after	Lenin's	death	Stalin	still	paid	attention	to	his	advice,	but	later	he	began	to disregard	the	serious	admonitions	of	Vladimir	Ilich.	When	we	analyse	the practice	of	Stalin	in	regard	to	the	direction	of	the	party	and	of	the	country;	when we	pause	to	consider	everything	which	Stalin	perpetrated,	we	must	be	convinced that	Lenin's	fears	were	justified.	The	negative	characteristics	of	Stalin,	which	in Lenin's	time	were	only	incipient,	transformed	themselves	during	the	last	years into	a	grave	abuse	of	power	by	Stalin,	which	caused	untold	harm	to	our	party…

## Stalin	acted	not	through	persuasion,	explanation,	and patient	co-operation	with	people,	but	by	imposing	his concepts	and	demanding	absolute	submission	to	his opinion…

Stalin	originated	the	concept	'enemy	of	the	people'.	This	term	automatically rendered	it	unnecessary	that	the	ideological	errors	of	a	man	or	men	engaged	in	a controversy	be	proven;	this	term	made	possible	the	usage	of	the	most	cruel repression,	violating	all	norms	of	revolutionary	legality,	against	anyone	who	in any	way	disagreed	with	Stalin,	against	those	who	were	only	suspected	of	hostile intent,	against	those	who	had	bad	reputations.

This	concept	-	'enemy	of	the	people'	-	actually	eliminated	the	possibility	of	any kind	of	ideological	fight	or	the	making	of	one's	views	known	on	this	or	that issue,	even	those	of	a	practical	character.	In	the	main,	and	in	actuality,	the	only proof	of	guilt	used,	against	all	norms	of	current	legal	science,	was	the	confession of	the	accused	himself,	and	as	subsequent	probing	proved,	confessions	were acquired	through	physical	pressures	against	the	accused.

This	led	to	glaring	violations	of	revolutionary	legality,	and	to	the	fact	that	many entirely	innocent	persons,	who	in	the	past	had	defended	the	party	line,	became victims…

Everyone	knows	how	irreconcilable	Lenin	was	with	the	ideological	enemies	of Marxism,	with	those	who	deviated	from	the	correct	party	line.	At	the	same	time, however,	Lenin…advised	that	such	people	should	be	patiently	educated,	without the	application	of	extreme	methods…An	entirely	different	relationship	with people	characterized	Stalin.

Lenin's	traits	-	patient	work	with	people,	stubborn	and	painstaking	education	of them,	the	ability	to	induce	people	to	follow	him	without	using	compulsion,	but rather	through	the	ideological	influence	on	them	of	the	whole	collective	-	were entirely	foreign	to	Stalin.	He	discarded	the	Leninist	method	of	convincing	and educating;	he	abandoned	the	method	of	ideological	struggle	for	that	of administrative	violence,	mass	repressions	and	terror…

Can	it	be	said	that	Lenin	did	not	decide	to	use	even	the	most	severe	means against	enemies	of	the	Revolution	when	this	was	actually	necessary?	No;	no	one can	say	this.	Vladimir	Ilich	demanded	uncompromising	dealings	with	the enemies	of	the	Revolution	and	of	the	working	class	and	when	necessary	resorted ruthlessly	to	such	methods.

You	will	recall	only	V	I	Lenin's	fight	with	the	Socialist	Revolutionary organizers	of	the	anti-Soviet	uprising, 2 with	the	counter-revolutionary	kulaks	in 1918	and	with	others,	when	Lenin	without	hesitation	used	the	most	extreme methods	against	the	enemies.	Lenin	used	such	methods,	however,	only	against actual	class	enemies	and	not	against	those	who	blunder,	who	err,	and	whom	it was	possible	to	lead	through	ideological	influence	and	even	retain	in	the leadership…

Stalin,	on	the	other	hand,	used	extreme	methods	and	mass	repressions	at	a	time when	the	Revolution	was	already	victorious,	when	the	Soviet	state	was strengthened,	when	the	exploiting	classes	were	already	liquidated	and	socialist relations	were	rooted	solidly	in	all	phases	of	national	economy;	when	our	party was	politically	consolidated	and	had	strengthened	itself	both	numerically	and ideologically…

Many	abuses	were	made	on	Stalin's	orders	without	reckoning	with	any	norms	of party	and	Soviet	legality.	Stalin	was	a	very	distrustful	man,	sickly	suspicious…

The	sickly	suspicion	created	in	him	a	general	distrust	even	toward	eminent	party workers	whom	he	had	known	for	years.	Everywhere	and	in	everything	he	saw 'enemies',	'two-facers'	and	'spies'.	Possessing	unlimited	power,	he	indulged	in great	wilfulness	and	stifled	people	morally	as	well	as	physically.	A	situation	was created	where	one	could	not	express	one's	own	volition…

Comrades:	the	cult	of	the	individual	acquired	such	monstrous	size	chiefly because	Stalin	himself,	using	all	conceivable	methods,	supported	the glorification	of	his	own	person.	This	is	supported	by	numerous	facts.	One	of	the most	characteristic	examples	of	Stalin's	self-glorification	and	of	his	lack	of	even elementary	modesty	is	the	edition	of	his Short	Biography ,	which	was	published in	1948. 3

This	book	is	an	expression	of	the	most	dissolute	flattery,	an	example	of	making	a man	into	a	godhead,	of	transforming	him	into	an	infallible	sage,	'the	greatest leader,	sublime	strategist	of	all	times	and	nations'.

We	need	not	give	here	examples	of	the	loathsome	adulation	filling	this	book.	All we	need	to	add	is	that	they	all	were	approved	and	edited	by	Stalin	personally. Some	of	them	were	added	in	his	own	handwriting	to	the	draft	text	of	the	book.

What	did	Stalin	consider	essential	to	write	into	this	book?	Did	he	want	to	cool the	ardour	of	the	flatterers	who	were	composing	his Short	Biography ?	No!	He marked	the	very	places	where	he	thought	that	the	praise	of	his	services	was insufficient.	Here	are	some	examples	characterizing	Stalin's	activity,	added	in Stalin's	own	hand…

'Although	he	performed	his	tasks	as	leader	of	the	party	and	the	people	with consummate	skill,	and	enjoyed	the	unreserved	support	of	the	entire	Soviet people,	Stalin	never	allowed	his	work	to	be	marred	by	the	slightest	hint	of vanity,	conceit	or	self-adulation.'

Where	and	when	could	a	leader	so	praise	himself?	Is	this	worthy	of	a	leader	of the	Marxist-Leninist	type?	No.	Precisely	against	this	did	Marx	and	Engels	take such	a	strong	position.	This	always	was	sharply	condemned	also	by	Vladimir Ilich	Lenin.

In	the	draft	text	of	his	book	appeared	the	following	sentence:	'Stalin	is	the	Lenin of	today.'	This	sentence	appeared	to	Stalin	to	be	too	weak.	Thus,	in	his	own handwriting,	he	changed	it	to	read:	'Stalin	is	the	worthy	continuer	of	Lenin's work,	or,	as	it	is	said	in	our	party,	Stalin	is	the	Lenin	of	today.'	You	see	how well	it	is	said,	not	by	the	nation	but	by	Stalin	himself…

Or	let	us	take	the	matter	of	the	Stalin	Prizes. 4

[Movement	in	the	hall.]

## Not	even	the	Tsars	created	prizes	which	they	named after	themselves.

Stalin	recognized	as	the	best	a	text	of	the	national	anthem	of	the	Soviet	Union which	contains	not	a	word	about	the	Communist	Party;	it	contains,	however,	the following	unprecedented	praise	of	Stalin:

In	these	lines	of	the	anthem,	the	whole	educational,	directional	and	inspirational activity	of	the	great	Leninist	Party	is	ascribed	to	Stalin.	This	is,	of	course,	a	clear deviation	from	Marxism-Leninism,	a	clear	debasing	and	belittling	of	the	role	of the	party.	We	should	add	for	your	information	that	the	presidium	of	the	central committee	has	already	passed	a	resolution	concerning	the	composition	of	a	new text	of	the	anthem,	which	will	reflect	the	role	of	the	people	and	the	role	of	the party. 5

## [Loud,	prolonged	applause.]

And	was	it	without	Stalin's	knowledge	that	many	of	the	largest	enterprises	and towns	were	named	after	him?	Was	it	without	his	knowledge	that	Stalin monuments	were	erected	in	the	whole	country	-	these	'memorials	to	the living'?…Anyone	who	has	visited	the	Stalingrad	area	must	have	seen	the	huge statue	which	is	being	built	there,	and	that	on	a	site	which	hardly	any	people frequent…

We	should,	in	all	seriousness,	consider	the	question	of	the	cult	of	the	individual.

We	cannot	let	this	matter	get	out	of	the	party,	especially	not	to	the	press.	It	is	for this	reason	that	we	are	considering	it	here	at	a	closed	congress	session.	We should	know	the	limits;	we	should	not	give	ammunition	to	the	enemy;	we	should not	wash	our	dirty	linen	before	their	eyes…

## Comrades:	we	must	abolish	the	cult	of	the	individual decisively,	once	and	for	all…

we	must	draw	the	proper	conclusions	concerning	both	ideological-theoretical and	practical	work.	It	is	necessary	for	this	purpose:	first,	in	a	Bolshevik	manner to	condemn	and	to	eradicate	the	cult	of	the	individual	as	alien	to	MarxismLeninism	and	not	consonant	with	the	principles	of	party	leadership	and	the norms	of	party	life,	and	to	fight	inexorably	all	attempts	at	bringing	back	this practice	in	one	form	or	another…

Second,	to	continue	systematically	and	consistently	the	work	done	by	the	party's central	committee	during	the	last	years,	a	work	characterized	by	minute observation	in	all	party	organizations,	from	the	bottom	to	the	top,	of	the	Leninist principles	of	party	leadership,	characterized,	above	all,	by	the	main	principle	of collective	leadership…

Third,	to	restore	completely	the	Leninist	principles	of	Soviet	Socialist democracy,	expressed	in	the	constitution	of	the	Soviet	Union,	to	fight	wilfulness of	individuals	abusing	their	power.	The	evil	caused	by	acts	violating revolutionary	socialist	legality	which	have	accumulated	during	a	long	time	as	a result	of	the	negative	influence	of	the	cult	of	the	individual	has	to	be	completely corrected.

Comrades:	the	20th	Congress	of	the	Communist	Party	of	the	Soviet	Union	has manifested	with	a	new	strength	the	unshakeable	unity	of	our	party,	its cohesiveness	around	the	central	committee,	its	resolute	will	to	accomplish	the great	task	of	building	communism.

## [Tumultuous	applause.]

And	the	fact	that	we	present	in	all	their	ramifications	the	basic	problems	of overcoming	the	cult	of	the	individual	which	is	alien	to	Marxism-Leninism,	as well	as	the	problem	of	liquidating	its	burdensome	consequences,	is	evidence	of the	great	moral	and	political	strength	of	our	party.

## [Prolonged	applause.]

We	are	absolutely	certain	that	our	party,	armed	with	the	historical	resolutions	of the	20th	Congress,	will	lead	the	Soviet	people	along	the	Leninist	path	to	new successes,	to	new	victories.

[Tumultuous,	prolonged	applause.]

Long	live	the	victorious	banner	of	our	party	-	Leninism!

[Tumultuous,	prolonged	applause	ending	in	standing	ovation.]

## Anthony	Eden

British	statesman

Robert	Anthony	Eden	later	1st	Earl	of	Avon	(1897-1977)	served	as	the Conservative	MP	for	Warwick	and	Leamington	from	1923	to	1957,	holding various	governmental	positions	including	that	of	Foreign	Secretary.	He succeeded	Churchill	as	prime	minister	in	1955	and	in	1956	he	ordered	British and	French	forces	to	occupy	the	Suez	Canal	Zone	ahead	of	the	invading	Israeli army.	His	action	was	condemned	by	the	United	Nations	and	caused	a	bitter	and prolonged	controversy	in	Britain	which	did	not	subside	when	he	ordered	a withdrawal.	In	failing	health,	he	abruptly	resigned	the	premiership	in	1957. Regarded	as	one	of	the	Western	world's	most	experienced	statesmen,	he	aimed principally	for	world	peace	based	on	respect	for	law.
