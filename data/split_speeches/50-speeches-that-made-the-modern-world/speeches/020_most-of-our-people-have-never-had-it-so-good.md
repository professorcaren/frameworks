## 'Most	of	our	people	have	never	had	it	so	good'

20	July	1957,	Bedford,	England

At	this	point	in	his	career,	Harold	Macmillan's	political	fortunes	were	rising to	their	zenith.	As	Chancellor,	he	had	been	labelled	'Supermac'	by	the newspaper	cartoonist	Vicky,	after	presiding	over	a	booming	British economy.	But	his	colonial	policy,	which	facilitated	independence	in	much	of what	remained	of	the	British	Empire,	made	him	unpopular	with	the	right	of his	party.	So	too	did	his	'One	Nation	Conservatism',	whose	economic	and social	philosophies	more	closely	resembled	the	post-war	social	democratic policies	of	Clement	Attlee	than	any	former	Tory	platform.

But,	whatever	his	issues	with	his	party,	Macmillan	was	popular	with	the country	at	large.	Having	inherited	a	thirteen-point	deficit	in	the	polls	at	his election	to	the	party	leadership,	he	would	win	the	1959	election	with	a	seven- point	lead.

However,	this	famous	speech	to	the	party	faithful	of	Bedford	was particularly	taxing	for	Macmillan,	partly	because	it	addresses	the	end	of Empire.	What	is	so	impressive	about	it	is	the	quiet	pragmatism	that characterized	his	policy-making.	He	thrived	by	his	well-known	credo:	'If people	want	a	sense	of	purpose	they	should	get	it	from	their	archbishop. They	should	certainly	not	get	it	from	their	politicians.'

Just	over	six	months	have	passed	since	severe	ill-health	forced	Sir	Anthony Eden	to	lay	down	his	burden.	To	all	of	us	-	his	friends	and	colleagues	-	this	was indeed	a	cruel	blow.	For	he	was	endowed	with	two	great	qualities	without	which no	politician,	however	able	or	however	brilliant,	can	aspire	to	the	name	of statesman.	These	are	courage	and	integrity.	He	had	both,	to	a	supreme	degree…

It	has	fallen	to	me	to	be	his	successor;	and	I	must	tell	you	that	I	feel	both encouraged	and	inspired	by	the	loyalty	and	comradeship	which	have	been	shown to	me	during	these	six	months…

This	meeting,	I	must	remind	you,	was	originally	planned	to	celebrate	the	jubilee of	Bedfordshire's	senior	Member.	Alan	Lennox-Boyd 1 	has	served	his constituency	for	an	unbroken	tenure	of	25	years.	Fortunately	he	is	still	quite	a young	man,	and	a	man	of	immense	vigour.	He	holds	today	one	of	the	most arduous	as	well	as	one	of	the	most	important	posts	in	the	Cabinet.	He	has	not spared	himself.	I	do	not	suppose	he	has	told	you	-	but	I	will	tell	you	-	that	since he	became	Colonial	Secretary,	only	three	years	ago,	he	has	travelled	80,000 miles	-	more	than	three	times	round	the	globe.	He	has	won	the	admiration	and respect	of	all	the	political	leaders	and	indeed	of	all	the	people	of	our	colonies.	He has	done	something	more	-	he	has	won	their	affection.	Peoples	of	every	race, religion	and	colour	have	come	to	look	upon	him	as	a	friend.

This	leads	me	to	say	something	about	changes	and	developments	which	have taken	place	in	the	Empire	during	recent	years.	I	know	there	are	some	people	who feel	concerned	at	what	is	happening.

## They	even	talk	about	the	disintegration	of	the	Empire.	It is	changing;	but	it	is	not	disintegrating.

Colonial	territories	are	taking	steps	everywhere	towards	self-government.	But we	should	take	pride	in	this,	for	it	is	we	who	have	taught	them;	who	have	set them	on	the	path.	Our	aim	has	always	been	to	lead	the	colonial	peoples	along	the road	to	self-government	within	the	Commonwealth…

There	is	not	a	colony	today	which	is	not	thinking	of	its	future	destiny.	People	are seeking	new	faiths	and	beliefs,	trying	to	adjust	themselves	to	the	sudden	impact of	new	thoughts,	ideas	and	invention.	But	we	must	not	be	frightened	by	what	is happening.	For	after	all,	it	is	of	our	own	making.

Of	all	political	forces,	the	new	rise	of	nationalism	is	the	most	powerful,	swift	and elemental.	It	can	be	stubborn	too.	It	can	be	led;	but	it	cannot	be	driven.	If	we	try to	drive	it	backwards,	we	shall	drive	it	to	communism.	Our	task	is	to	guide	these forces	with	sympathy	and	understanding.	To	this	work	nobody	has	given	greater service	than	the	Colonial	Secretary.	He	is	supported	by	the	splendid	officers	of our	fine	colonial	service.

In	the	long	history	of	the	past,	the	world	has	seen	the	rise	and	fall	of	great empires.

Let	us	take	pride	in	this	-	that	Britain	is	the	only	power	which	has,	of	its	own volition,	set	about	the	task	of	giving	full	independence	to	all	parts	of	its	Empire as	they	become	able	to	manage	their	own	affairs.

## This	is	not	a	sunset;	it	is	the	coming	of	a	new	dawn…

Yet,	despite	all	this,	Great	Britain	is	charged	with	'imperialism'	and 'colonialism'.	So	constant,	indeed,	have	these	attacks	become	that	'colonialism' has	almost	come	to	be	the	signature	tune	of	the	Moscow	Radio	and	the	'Voice	of the	Arabs'	in	Cairo.

Let	us	contrast	our	own	record	with	that	of	our	communist	accusers.	Whilst	100 million	people	in	Europe	alone	have,	since	the	war,	been	fully	absorbed	into	the communist	bloc,	more	than	five	times	that	number	in	Asia	and	Africa	have	been helped	to	nationhood	by	governments	of	this	country.	Turn	now	to	the	last	few months	-	four	million	citizens	in	Ghana	have	been	built	into	a	new	free	nation, while	for	ten	million	Hungarians	freedom	has	been	crushed	by	the	Red	Army…

The	countries	of	the	Commonwealth	and	of	the	colonial	empire	look	to	us	for leadership	in	many	fields.

First,	defence.	Here	I	am	happy	to	tell	you	what	a	fine	job	the	Member	for Bedford,	Mr	Christopher	Soames, 2 	is	doing	in	his	new	post.	And	by	the	way, your	county	of	Bedford	is	really	a	very	satisfactory	county	politically:	all	four Members	support	the	government.	Three	of	them	are	in	the	government	-	two	in the	Cabinet	-	and	the	fourth	is	an	energetic	and	hard-working	backbencher.	No Mr	Faint	Hearts	here,	or	among	the	thousands	who	send	them	to	the	House	of Commons.

In	defence	I	have	continued	the	policy	started	by	Mr	Attlee	and	carried	on	by	Sir Winston	Churchill	and	Sir	Anthony	Eden,	and	now	reaching	its	fruition.	That	is to	say,	we	are	making	Britain	an	atomic	and	nuclear	power.	This	is	not	the	time for	me	to	talk	about	defence	in	any	detail.	As	you	know,	we	are	engaged	upon	a recasting	of	our	defence	services.	It	will	be	a	long	job,	and	a	difficult	one.	And remember,	on	our	success	depends	the	end	of	conscription	and	the	return	to volunteer	or	regular	forces…

For	so	long	as	I	can	remember,	this	country	has	been	the	traditional	source	of capital	for	the	Commonwealth	and	the	Empire.	During	the	Victorian	and Edwardian	eras	this	reached	immense	figures.	Indeed,	it	was	to	British	capital that	not	only	the	Commonwealth	and	the	colonies,	but	a	great	part	of	the	world	including	the	United	States	-	owed	the	foundations	of	their	prosperity.

At	the	culminating	point	of	this	operation	-	that	is,	in	the	years	immediately preceding	the	First	War	-	Great	Britain	is	believed	to	have	exported	some	7	per cent	of	her	national	income.	Now,	after	two	World	Wars	-	and	many	other	calls upon	our	resources	which	are	absolutely	essential	if	we	are	to	keep	ahead	in	the race	and	maintain	our	investing	power	-	we	cannot	hope	to	do	as	much.	But	we are	still	doing	pretty	well…

Our	problem	today	is	how	to	do	all	the	things	that	we	want	to	do.	We	want	to invest	in	the	Commonwealth.

We	want	to	improve	conditions	among	the	millions	of	people	in	Asia	and	Africa whose	living	standards	are	too	low	-	and	incidentally	if	we	improve	their conditions	we	shall	improve	the	markets	for	our	goods.	We	want	to	re-equip	our factories	and	farms	with	the	most	up-to-date	plant	and	machinery.	We	want	to maintain	and,	if	we	can,	improve	our	social	services.	And	we	must	of	course play	our	proper	part	in	defence.

All	these	things	together	make	up	a	heavy	task,	which	we	have	succeeded	in meeting	over	the	last	six	years…Our	general	prospects	are	good.	The	balance	of payments	prospects	are	favourable	-	we	look	like	earning	a	really	worthwhile surplus	this	year…

These	increased	earnings	come	from	the	increasing	production	of	most	of	our main	industries	-	steel,	coal,	motorcars	-	a	large	part	of	the	increase	in	output	is going	to	exports	or	to	investments.	That	is	all	to	the	good.	Indeed,	let's	be	frank about	it:	most	of	our	people	have	never	had	it	so	good.

Go	around	the	country,	go	to	the	industrial	towns,	go	to	the	farms,	and	you	will see	a	state	of	prosperity	such	as	we	have	never	had	in	my	lifetime	-	nor	indeed ever	in	the	history	of	this	country.	What	is	beginning	to	worry	some	of	us	is,	'Is it	too	good	to	be	true?'	-	or	perhaps	I	should	say,	'Is	it	too	good	to	last?'	For, amidst	all	this	prosperity,	there	is	one	problem	that	has	troubled	us	-	in	one	way or	another	-	ever	since	the	war.	It's	the	problem	of	rising	prices.

Our	constant	concern	today	is	-	can	prices	be	steadied	while	at	the	same	time	we maintain	full	employment	in	an	expanding	economy?	Can	we	control	inflation? This	is	the	problem	of	our	time.

It	is	true	that	prices	have	risen	less	since	we	took	office.	It	is	true	that	wages,	and in	the	main	salaries,	have	more	than	held	their	own	in	the	race.	Taking	the	nation as	a	whole,	compared	with	six	years	ago,	personal	incomes	are	40	per	cent	up, and	though	prices	have	risen	they	have	only	risen	by	20	per	cent.	I	read	in	the Daily	Mirror this	week	a	statement	which	said	that	the	people	were	worried	at 'too	small	wages	chasing	too	big	bills'.	Whatever	else	is	true,	this	isn't	true. Wages	have	risen	far	beyond	prices.	But	we	must	not,	and	we	do	not	intend	to allow	these	facts	to	blind	us	to	the	dangers…

Last	year,	when	I	was	Chancellor,	I	described	our	position	as	brilliant	but precarious.	There	must	always	be	a	risk,	and	it	is	surely	the	lesson	in	life	not	to take	too	much	or	press	an	advantage	too	far.	If	we	do	we	may	lose	the	greatest social	and	economic	benefit	that	has	come	to	us	since	the	war	-	security.

## The	Conservative	Party	is	not	the	party	of	any	class	or section.	We	govern	in	the	interests	of	the	whole nation…

and	we	cannot	forget	that	some	sections	of	the	people	have	not	shared	in	this general	prosperity. 3 These	are	those	who	live	on	fixed	incomes,	including	those who	have	retired	from	active	work.	We	cannot,	as	a	national	party,	see	their interests	sacrificed.	The	government	have	a	clear	duty	in	this	matter,	and	we intend	to	discharge	it…

In	the	long	run,	there	is	only	one	answer	to	the	$64,000-dollar	question 4 	-	to increase	production.	That's	the	answer.	That	is	where	the	real	hope	lies.	That	is why	the	Chancellor	of	the	Exchequer	last	April	gave	new	incentives	through lower	taxation.	That	has	been	our	policy	ever	since	1951	-	in	six	out	of	seven budgets,	the	burden	of	taxation	has	been	lowered.	The	nation	today	is	paying £800	million	a	year	less	in	taxes	than	it	would	be	paying	if	the	Socialist	rates	of 1951	had	been	maintained.

But	you	know,	the	government	cannot	do	this	all	alone.

Of	course,	government	action	is	needed	and	is	being	taken.	But	by	itself	it cannot	solve	the	problem.	This	is	a	combined	operation.	We	are	all	in	it	government,	industry,	the	general	public.	What	we	need	is	restraint	and	common sense	-	restraint	in	the	demands	we	make,	and	common	sense	on	how	we	spend our	income.	But	the	only	form	of	restraint	which	can	work	in	a	free	society	is self-restraint…

This	then	is	my	theme,	and	this	my	message	to	you.	An	expanding Commonwealth,	changing	but	taking	new	form,	shedding	old	methods	but reaching	out	to	great	new	possibilities;	Britain	the	centre	of	it,	trusted	by	all	and honoured	as	the	natural	leader.	A	material	development	of	the	Commonwealth	to which	Britain	is	making	the	largest	contribution	of	any	country	in	the	world	in money,	and	to	which	she	can	make	increasing	contributions	in	technical	skill	and experience.

Our	own	country	buoyant,	determined	to	maintain	a	high	rate	of	investment,	a high	rate	of	savings	and	determined	too	to	conquer	the	danger	of	inflation	by rising	activity.

So,	midway	through	this	year	1957,	we	are	masters	of	our	own	fate.	It	lies	in	our own	hands;	with	wisdom,	good	sense,	good	feeling	and	comradeship,	we	can achieve	our	purpose.	I	have	no	doubt	at	all	what	the	outcome	will	be.

## Patrice	Lumumba

## Congolese	politician

Patrice	Hemery	Lumumba	(1925-61)	helped	form	the	Mouvement	national congolais	(MNC)	in	1958	to	challenge	Belgian	rule	and,	when	Congo	became	an independent	republic,	became	its	first	prime	minister	(1960).	He	sought	a	unified Congo	and	opposed	the	secession	of	Katanga	Province	under	Moise	Tshombe. Less	than	three	months	after	coming	to	power,	he	was	arrested	by	his	own	army, handed	over	to	the	Katangese,	brutalized	and	eventually	murdered	in	January 1961.	His	name,	however,	remains	significant	as	the	embodiment	of	African nationalism	and	as	an	opponent	of	Balkanization	manipulated	by	ex-colonial countries	and	their	allies.
