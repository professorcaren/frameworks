## 'The	ethos	of	Islam	is	equality,	equality	between	the

sexes'

4	September	1995,	Beijing,	China

'Action	for	Equality,	Development	and	Peace'	was	the	mandate	of	the	Fourth United	Nations	World	Conference	on	Women,	held	in	Beijing	between	4	and 15	September	1995.	However,	disagreement	on	the	role	of	the	family	and female	sexuality	arose	between	groups	of	largely	Western	feminists	and	a coalition	of	fundamentalist	Christians,	Islamists	and	traditional	Catholics. This	dispute	disrupted	meetings	convened	to	prepare	the	'Platform	of Action',	the	paper	to	be	discussed	at	the	conference.

The	conference's	opening	ceremony	was	held	at	the	Great	Hall	of	the	People in	Tiananmen	Square,	and	representatives	from	189	countries	sat	through	a display	of	dancing,	music,	fashion	and	gymnastics	felt	by	many	to	have	been more	suited	to	an	Olympic	opening	ceremony	than	a	conference	discussing the	role	of	women.	Following	this	extravaganza	and	the	formal	opening	of the	conference,	Benazir	Bhutto	addressed	the	first	plenary	meeting,	speaking in	a	dazzling	style	honed	during	her	tenure	as	President	of	the	Oxford	Union debating	society.	In	her	speech	she	defended	Islam	while	condemning fundamentalism,	and	although	she	conformed	with	the	Islamic	requirement to	cover	her	head	in	public,	her	headscarf	continually	slipped	from	her	head as	she	spoke.

As	the	female	leader	of	an	Islamic	nation,	educated	in	the	West,	Bhutto exemplified	the	tension	between	the	opposite	sides	at	the	conference,	and	her speech	trod	a	careful	line	between	these	extremes.

As	the	first	woman	ever	elected	to	head	an	Islamic	nation,	I	feel	a	special responsibility	about	issues	that	relate	to	women.

In	addressing	the	new	exigencies	of	the	new	century,	we	must	translate	dynamic religion	into	a	living	reality.

## We	must	live	by	the	true	spirit	of	Islam,	not	only	by	its rituals.

And	for	those	of	you	who	may	be	ignorant	of	Islam,	cast	aside	your preconceptions	about	the	role	of	women	in	our	religion.	Contrary	to	what	many of	you	may	have	come	to	believe,	Islam	embraces	a	rich	variety	of	political, social,	and	cultural	traditions.	The	fundamental	ethos	of	Islam	is	tolerance, dialogue,	and	democracy.

Just	as	in	Christianity	and	Judaism,	we	must	always	be	on	guard	for	those	who will	exploit	and	manipulate	the	Holy	Book 1 	for	their	own	narrow	political	ends, who	will	distort	the	essence	of	pluralism	and	tolerance	for	their	own	extremist agendas.

To	those	who	claim	to	speak	for	Islam	but	who	would	deny	to	women	our	place in	society,	I	say:

The	ethos	of	Islam	is	equality,	equality	between	the	sexes.	There	is	no	religion on	earth	that,	in	its	writing	and	teachings,	is	more	respectful	of	the	role	of women	in	society	than	Islam.

My	presence	here,	as	the	elected	woman	prime	minister	of	a	great	Muslim country,	is	testament	to	the	commitment	of	Islam	to	the	role	of	women	in society.

It	is	this	tradition	of	Islam	that	has	empowered	me,	has	strengthened	me,	has emboldened	me.	It	was	this	heritage	that	sustained	me	during	the	most	difficult points	in	my	life,	for	Islam	forbids	injustice;	injustice	against	people,	against nations,	against	women.	It	denounces	inequality	as	the	gravest	form	of	injustice. It	enjoins	its	followers	to	combat	oppression	and	tyranny.	It	enshrines	piety	as the	sole	criterion	for	judging	humankind.	It	shuns	race,	colour,	and	gender	as	a basis	of	distinction	amongst	fellow	men.

## When	the	human	spirit	was	immersed	in	the	darkness	of the	Middle	Ages,	Islam	proclaimed	equality	between men	and	women.

When	women	were	viewed	as	inferior	members	of	the	human	family,	Islam	gave them	respect	and	dignity.	When	women	were	treated	as	chattels,	the	Prophet	of Islam	(peace	be	upon	him)	accepted	them	as	equal	partners.

Islam	codified	the	rights	of	women.	The	Koran	elevated their	status	to	that	of	men.	It	guaranteed	their	civic, economic,	and	political	rights.	It	recognized	their participative	role	in	nation	building.

Sadly,	the	Islamic	tenets	regarding	women	were	soon	discarded.	In	Islamic society,	as	in	other	parts	of	the	world,	their	rights	were	denied.	Women	were maltreated,	discriminated	against,	and	subjected	to	violence	and	oppression,	their dignity	injured	and	their	role	denied.

Women	became	the	victims	of	a	culture	of	exclusion	and	male	dominance. Today	more	women	than	men	suffer	from	poverty,	deprivation,	and discrimination.

Half	a	billion	women	are	illiterate.	Seventy	per	cent	of	the	children	who	are denied	elementary	education	are	girls.

The	plight	of	women	in	the	developing	countries	is	unspeakable.	Hunger, disease,	and	unremitting	toil	is	their	fate.	Weak	economic	growth	and	inadequate social	support	systems	affect	them	most	seriously	and	directly.	They	are	the primary	victims	of	structural	adjustment	processes,	which	necessitate	reduced state	funding	for	health,	education,	medical	care	and	nutrition.	Curtailed resource-flows	to	these	vital	areas	impact	most	severely	on	the	vulnerable groups,	particularly	women	and	children.

This,	Madam	Chairperson,	is	not	acceptable.	It	offends	my	religion.	It	offends my	sense	of	justice	and	equity.	Above	all,	it	offends	commonsense.

That	is	why	Pakistan,	the	women	of	Pakistan,	and	I	personally	have	been	fully engaged	in	recent	international	efforts	to	uphold	women's	rights.	The	Universal Declaration	of	Human	Rights	enjoins	the	elimination	of	discrimination	against women.

The	Nairobi	Forward-looking	Strategies 2 	provide	a	solid	framework	for advancing	women's	rights	around	the	world.	But	the	goal	of	equality, development	and	peace	still	eludes	us.

Sporadic	efforts	in	this	direction	have	failed.	We	are	satisfied	that	the	Beijing Platform	of	Action 3 	encompasses	a	comprehensive	approach	toward	the empowerment	of	women.	This	is	the	right	approach	and	should	be	fully supported.

Women	cannot	be	expected	to	struggle	alone	against	the	forces	of	discrimination and	exploitation.	I	recall	the	words	of	Dante,	who	reminded	us	that,	'The	hottest place	in	Hell	is	reserved	for	those	who	remain	neutral	in	times	of	moral	crisis.' 4

Today	in	this	world,	in	the	fight	for	the	liberation	of	women,	there	can	be	no neutrality.

My	spirit	carries	many	a	scar	of	along	and	lonely	battle	against	dictatorship	and tyranny.	I	witnessed,	at	a	young	age,	the	overthrow	of	democracy,	the assassination	of	an	elected	prime	minister, 5 	and	a	systematic	assault	against	the very	foundations	of	a	free	society.

But	our	faith	in	democracy	was	not	broken.	The	great	Pakistani	poet	and philosopher	Dr	Allam	Iqbal 6 	says,	'Tyranny	cannot	endure	for	ever'.	It	did	not. The	will	of	our	people	prevailed	against	the	forces	of	dictatorship.

But,	my	dear	sisters,	we	have	learned	that	democracy	alone	is	not	enough. Freedom	of	choice	alone	does	not	guarantee	justice.	Equal	rights	are	not	defined only	by	political	values.	Social	justice	is	a	triad	of	freedom,	an	equation	of liberty.

## Justice	is	political	liberty.	Justice	is	economic independence.	Justice	is	social	equality.

Delegates,	sisters,	the	child	who	is	starving	has	no	human	rights.	The	girl	who	is illiterate	has	no	future.	The	woman	who	cannot	plan	her	life,	plan	her	family, plan	a	career,	is	fundamentally	not	free.

I	am	determined	to	change	the	plight	of	women	in	my	country.	More	than	60 million	of	our	women	are	largely	sidelined.	It	is	a	personal	tragedy	for	them.	It	is a	national	catastrophe	for	my	nation.	I	am	determined	to	harness	their	potential to	the	gigantic	task	of	nation-building.

I	dream	of	a	Pakistan	in	which	women	contribute	to	their	full	potential.

I	am	conscious	of	the	struggle	that	lies	ahead.	But,	with	your	help,	we	shall persevere.	Allah	willing,	we	shall	succeed.

## Bill	Clinton

## American	politician

William	Jefferson	Clinton	(1946-)	taught	law	at	the	University	of	Arkansas (1973-6),	marrying	Hillary	Clinton	(née	Rodham)	in	1975.	He	was	elected Attorney	General	(1976),	then	governor	(1978)	of	Arkansas,	in	which	role	he served	for	five	terms	(1979-81,	1983-92).	In	1992,	he	defeated	President George	H	W	Bush	and	was	elected	president,	thus	ending	a	12-year	Republican hold	on	the	office.	He	was	a	popular	and	charismatic	figure,	and	his	presidency saw	economic	prosperity,	with	low	inflation	and	unemployment,	and	a	focus	on promoting	peace	on	the	international	stage.	However,	it	was	also	marked	by scandal,	most	notably	in	1998	with	his	affair	with	White	House	intern	Monica Lewinsky.	Despite	such	troubles,	by	the	time	he	stepped	down	in	January	2001, he	had	the	highest	approval	rating	of	any	outgoing	president	since	records	began.
