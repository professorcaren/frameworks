## 'We	never	have	and	we	never	should	walk	by	on	the other	side	of	the	road'

2	December	2015,	London,	England

This	was	the	final	speech	in	a	long	and	passionate	debate	in	the	House	of Commons.	Under	discussion	was	a	government	motion	to	extend	air	strikes in	the	Middle	East.	This	was	a	response	the	growing	might	of	Daesh	-	also known	as	ISIS,	ISIL	or	Islamic	State.	This	highly	organized	group	uses violence	and	terror	in	pursuit	of	its	goal	of	a	'global	caliphate'	-	political	and military	control	of	the	world's	Muslim	populations.	The	British	government, led	by	Conservative	Prime	Minister	David	Cameron,	had	already	ordered bombing	raids	on	Daesh-held	regions	in	Iraq.	The	proposal	was	to	extend	air strikes	into	Syria,	where	Daesh	also	holds	swathes	of	territory.

As	Shadow	Foreign	Secretary,	Benn	supported	the	motion.	In	doing	so,	he disagreed	with	his	party	leader,	Jeremy	Corbyn,	the	left-wing	Leader	of	the Opposition,	who	had	reluctantly	allowed	his	party	a	free	vote	on	the	issue. Concerned	over	an	'ill-thought-out	rush	to	war',	Corbyn	had	refused	to	back the	government	motion.	Cameron	had	criticized	opponents	of	the	motion	as 'a	bunch	of	terrorist	sympathizers',	a	slur	which	he	refused	to	withdraw.

Benn's	speech	was	greeted	with	cheers	and	applause	-	not	normally permitted	in	the	House	of	Commons.	The	motion	was	passed	by	397	votes	to 223,	a	comfortable	majority	of	174.	The	media	response	was	mostly	very positive,	though	in	some	quarters,	Benn	was	compared	unfavourably	to	his father,	the	late	Tony	Benn,	a	left-wing	pacifist	who	would	almost	certainly have	opposed	the	motion.

Thank	you	very	much,	Mr	Speaker.	Before	I	respond	to	the	debate,	I	would like	to	say	this	directly	to	the	Prime	Minister:	although	my	right	honourable friend	the	Leader	of	the	Opposition	and	I	will	walk	into	different	division lobbies 1 tonight,	I	am	proud	to	speak	from	the	same	Despatch	Box	as	him.	My right	honourable	friend	is	not	a	terrorist	sympathizer.	He	is	an	honest,	a principled,	a	decent	and	a	good	man,	and	I	think	the	Prime	Minister	must	now regret	what	he	said	yesterday	and	his	failure	to	do	what	he	should	have	done today,	which	is	simply	to	say,	'I	am	sorry.'

Now,	Mr	Speaker,	we	have	had	an	intense	and	impassioned	debate	-	and	rightly so,	given	the	clear	and	present	threat	from	Daesh,	the	gravity	of	the	decision	that rests	upon	the	shoulders	and	the	conscience	of	every	single	one	of	us,	and	the lives	that	we	hold	in	our	hands	tonight.	And	whatever	decision	we	reach,	I	hope we	will	treat	one	another	with	respect… 2

The	question	which	confronts	us	in	a	very,	very	complex	conflict	is	at	its	heart very	simple.

What	should	we	do	with	others	to	confront	this	threat	to our	citizens,	our	nation,	other	nations	and	the	people who	suffer	under	the	yoke,	the	cruel	yoke,	of	Daesh?

The	carnage	in	Paris 3 	brought	home	to	us	the	clear	and	present	danger	we	face from	them.	It	could	just	as	easily	have	been	London	or	Glasgow	or	Leeds	or Birmingham	-	and	it	could	still	be.	And	I	believe	that	we	have	a	moral	and	a practical	duty	to	extend	the	action	we	are	already	taking	in	Iraq	to	Syria.	And	I am	also	clear	-	and	I	say	this	to	my	colleagues	-	that	the	conditions	set	out	in	the emergency	resolution	passed	at	the	Labour	Party	conference	in	September 4 	have been	met.	We	now	have	a	clear	and	unambiguous	UN	Security	Council resolution	2249,	paragraph	five	of	which	specifically	calls	on	member	states	to take	all	necessary	measures;	to	redouble	and	co-ordinate	their	efforts	to	prevent and	suppress	terrorist	acts	committed	specifically	by	ISIL	and	to	eradicate	the safe	haven	they	have	established	over	significant	parts	of	Iraq	and	Syria.

So	the	United	Nations	is	asking	us	to	do	something.	It	is	asking	us	to	do something	now…

So	given	that	the	United	Nations	has	passed	this	resolution,	given	that	such action	would	be	lawful	under	Article	51	of	the	UN	Charter 5 	-	because	every	state has	the	right	to	defend	itself	-	why	would	we	not	uphold	the	settled	will	of	the United	Nations,	particularly	when	there	is	such	support	from	within	the	region, including	from	Iraq?

We	are	part	of	a	coalition	of	over	60	countries	standing	together	shoulder	to shoulder	to	oppose	their	ideology	and	their	brutality.	Now,	Mr	Speaker,	all	of	us understand	the	importance	of	bringing	an	end	to	the	Syrian	civil	war, 6 	and	there is	now	some	progress	on	a	peace	plan	because	of	the	Vienna	talks. 7 	They	are	the best	hope	we	have	of	achieving	a	ceasefire.	Now	that	would	bring	an	end	to Assad's	bombing,	leading	to	a	transitional	government	and	elections.	And	why is	that	vital?	Both	because	it	will	help	in	the	defeat	of	Daesh	and	because	it would	enable	millions	of	Syrians	who	have	been	forced	to	flee	to	do	what	every refugee	dreams	of:	they	just	want	to	be	able	to	go	home.

Now,	Mr	Speaker,	no	one	in	this	debate	doubts	the	deadly	serious	threat	we	face from	Daesh	and	what	they	do	-	although	sometimes	we	find	it	hard	to	live	with the	reality…

We	know	they	have	killed	30	British	tourists	in	Tunisia, 8 	224	Russian holidaymakers	on	a	plane, 9 	178	people	in	suicide	bombings	in	Beirut,	Ankara and	Suruç, 10 130	people	in	Paris	-	including	those	young	people	in	the	Bataclan, whom	Daesh,	in	trying	to	justify	their	bloody	slaughter,	called	them	apostates engaged	in	prostitution	and	vice.	If	it	had	happened	here,	they	could	have	been our	children.	And	we	know	they	are	plotting	more	attacks.

So	the	question	for	each	of	us	and	for	our	national	security	is	this:	given	that	we know	what	they	are	doing,	can	we	really	stand	aside	and	refuse	to	act	fully	in	our self-defence	against	those	who	are	planning	these	attacks?	Can	we	really	leave	to others	the	responsibility	for	defending	our	national	security	when	it	is	our responsibility?	And	if	we	do	not	act,	what	message	would	that	send	about	our solidarity	with	those	countries	that	have	suffered	so	much,	including	Iraq	and our	ally	France?…

Now,	Mr	Speaker,	it	has	been	argued	in	the	debate	that	air	strikes	achieve nothing.	Not	so.	Look	at	how	Daesh's	forward	march	has	been	halted	in	Iraq

The	house	will	remember	that	14	months	ago	people	were	saying,	'They	are almost	at	the	gates	of	Baghdad.'	And	that	is	why	we	voted	to	respond	to	the	Iraqi government's	request	for	help	to	defeat	them.	Look	at	how	their	military capacity	and	their	freedom	of	movement	has	been	put	under	pressure.	Ask	the Kurds	about	Sinjar	and	Kobanî 11 …

And	so	to	suggest,	Mr	Speaker,	that	air	strikes	should	not	take	place	until	the Syrian	civil	war	has	come	to	an	end	is,	I	think,	to	miss	the	urgency	of	the terrorist	threat	that	Daesh	poses	to	us	and	others	and	I	think	misunderstands	the nature	and	objectives	of	the	extension	to	air	strikes	that	is	being	proposed.

And	of	course	we	should	take	action	-	it	is	not	a	contradiction	between	the	two	to	cut	off	Daesh's	support	in	the	form	of	money	and	fighters	and	weapons.	And of	course	we	should	give	humanitarian	aid,	and	of	course	we	should	offer	shelter to	more	refugees,	including	in	this	country,	and	yes	we	should	commit	to	play our	full	part	in	helping	to	rebuild	Syria	when	the	war	is	over.

Now	I	accept	that	there	are	legitimate	arguments,	and	we've	heard	them	in	the debate,	for	not	taking	this	form	of	action	now,	and	it	is	also	clear	that	many members	have	wrestled	-	and	who	knows,	in	the	time	that	is	left	may	still	be wrestling	-	with	what	the	right	thing	to	do	is.	But	I	say	the	threat	is	now	and there	are	rarely	if	ever	perfect	circumstances	in	which	to	deploy	military	forces.

Now	we	heard	very	powerful	testimony	from	the	honourable	member	for Eddisbury	earlier	when	she	quoted	that	passage, 12 	and	I	just	want	to	read	what Karwan	Jamal	Tahir,	the	Kurdistan	regional	government	high	representative	in London,	said	last	week,	and	I	quote:	'Last	June,	Daesh	captured	one	third	of	Iraq overnight,	and	a	few	months	later	attacked	the	Kurdistan	region.	Swift	air	strikes by	Britain,	America	and	France,	and	the	actions	of	our	own	Peshmerga 13 	saved us.	We	now	have	a	border	of	650	miles	with	Daesh.	We	have	pushed	them	back and	recently	captured	Sinjar.	Again,	Western	air	strikes	were	vital.	But	the	old border	between	Iraq	and	Syria	does	not	exist.	Daesh	fighters	come	and	go	across this	fictional	boundary.'

And	that	is	the	argument,	Mr	Speaker,	for	treating	the	two	countries	as	one	if	we are	serious	about	defeating	Daesh.

Now,	Mr	Speaker,	I	hope	the	House	will	bear	with	me	if	I	direct	my	closing remarks	to	my	Labour	friends	and	colleagues	on	this	side	of	the	House.

## As	a	party,	we	have	always	been	defined	by	our internationalism.	We	believe	we	have	a	responsibility one	to	another.	We	never	have	and	we	never	should walk	by	on	the	other	side	of	the	road. 14

And	we	are	here	faced	by	fascists.	Not	just	their	calculated	brutality,	but	their belief	that	they	are	superior	to	every	single	one	of	us	here	tonight,	and	all	of	the people	that	we	represent.	They	hold	us	in	contempt.	They	hold	our	values	in contempt.	They	hold	our	belief	in	tolerance	and	decency	in	contempt.	They	hold our	democracy,	the	means	by	which	we	will	make	our	decision	tonight,	in contempt.

And	what	we	know	about	fascists	is	that	they	need	to	be	defeated.	And	it	is	why, as	we	have	heard	tonight,	socialists	and	trade	unionists	and	others	joined	the International	Brigade 15 in	the	1930s	to	fight	against	Franco.	It's	why	this	entire House	stood	up	against	Hitler	and	Mussolini.	It	is	why	our	party	has	always stood	up	against	the	denial	of	human	rights	and	for	justice.	And	my	view,	Mr Speaker,	is	that	we	must	now	confront	this	evil.	It	is	now	time	for	us	to	do	our bit	in	Syria.	And	that	is	why	I	ask	my	colleagues	to	vote	for	this	motion	tonight.
