## 'I	lay	down	my	burden'

11	December	1936,	Windsor,	England

Edward	was	a	very	popular	Prince	of	Wales	in	the	1920s	and	1930s.	His manner	was	charming	and	informal:	impatient	of	tradition	and	ceremony,	he hoped	to	modernize	the	British	monarchy.	He	told	his	grandmother	Queen Alexandra	in	1914	that	he	would	only	marry	someone	he	loved,	and	in	the years	following	World	War	I	he	was	attracted	to	many	women,	but	none	was thought	suitable	to	marry	the	heir	to	the	throne.	In	1930	he	met	the	American divorcee	Wallis	Simpson	-	who	had	already	remarried	-	and	became increasingly	attached	to	her.	The	American	newspapers	publicized	the relationship,	but	British	papers	did	not.

When	Edward	succeeded	to	the	throne	on	20	January	1936,	he	was	required to	behave	more	formally.	However,	believing	that	the	British	people	were beginning	to	accept	the	idea	of	remarriage	after	divorce,	he	planned	to	marry Mrs	Simpson	following	her	second	divorce	in	October	1936.	The	incumbent prime	minister,	Stanley	Baldwin,	and	church	leaders	felt	strongly	that	a divorced	woman	was	ineligible	to	be	the	wife	and	queen	consort	of	the monarch	because	of	his	role	as	head	of	the	Church	of	England.	Edward	then faced	his	famous	romantic	dilemma:	he	could	remain	king	without	marrying Mrs	Simpson,	or	abdicate	and	marry	her.	He	chose	the	latter	course	and made	this	broadcast	to	a	stunned	nation,	which	had	been	largely	unaware	of the	situation.

Winston	Churchill	supported	Edward	at	the	time,	but	later	said	that	his abdication	had	turned	out	for	the	best,	since	Edward's	younger	brother George	VI	was	an	ideal	monarch	and	his	wife,	Queen	Elizabeth,	an	ideal consort.

At	long	last	I	am	able	to	say	a	few	words	of	my	own.	I	have	never	wanted	to withhold	anything,	but	until	now	it	has	not	been	constitutionally	possible	for	me to	speak.

A	few	hours	ago,	I	discharged	my	last	duty	as	king	and	emperor,	and	now	that	I have	been	succeeded	by	my	brother,	the	Duke	of	York, 1 	my	first	words	must	be to	declare	my	allegiance	to	him.	This	I	do	with	all	my	heart.

You	all	know	the	reasons	which	have	impelled	me	to	renounce	the	Throne.	But	I want	you	to	understand	that	in	making	up	my	mind	I	did	not	forget	the	country or	the	empire	which,	as	Prince	of	Wales,	and	lately	as	king,	I	have	for	25	years tried	to	serve.

But	you	must	believe	me	when	I	tell	you	that	I	have	found	it	impossible	to	carry the	heavy	burden	of	responsibility	and	to	discharge	my	duties	as	king	as	I	would wish	to	do	without	the	help	and	support	of	the	woman	I	love.

And	I	want	you	to	know	that	the	decision	I	have	made	has	been	mine	and	mine alone.	This	was	a	thing	I	had	to	judge	entirely	for	myself.	The	other	person	most nearly	concerned	has	tried	up	to	the	last	to	persuade	me	to	take	a	different course.	I	have	made	this,	the	most	serious	decision	of	my	life,	only	upon	the single	thought	of	what	would	in	the	end	be	best	for	all.

This	decision	has	been	made	less	difficult	to	me	by	the	sure	knowledge	that	my brother,	with	his	long	training	in	the	public	affairs	of	this	country	and	with	his fine	qualities,	will	be	able	to	take	my	place	forthwith,	without	interruption	or injury	to	the	life	and	progress	of	the	Empire.	And	he	has	one	matchless	blessing, enjoyed	by	so	many	of	you	and	not	bestowed	on	me	-	a	happy	home	with	his wife	and	children.

During	these	hard	days,	I	have	been	comforted	by	Her	Majesty	my	mother	and by	my	family.	The	ministers	of	the	crown,	and	in	particular	Mr	Baldwin,	the prime	minister,	have	always	treated	me	with	full	consideration.	There	has	never been	any	constitutional	difference	between	me	and	them	and	between	me	and Parliament.	Bred	in	the	constitutional	tradition	by	my	father,	I	should	never	have allowed	any	such	issue	to	arise.

Ever	since	I	was	Prince	of	Wales,	and	later	on	when	I	occupied	the	Throne,	I have	been	treated	with	the	greatest	kindness	by	all	classes	of	the	people, wherever	I	have	lived	or	journeyed	throughout	the	Empire.	For	that	I	am	very grateful.

I	now	quit	altogether	public	affairs,	and	I	lay	down	my	burden.

It	may	be	some	time	before	I	return	to	my	native	land,	but	I	shall	always	follow the	fortunes	of	the	British	race	and	Empire	with	profound	interest,	and	if	at	any time	in	the	future	I	can	be	found	of	service	to	His	Majesty	in	a	private	station	I shall	not	fail.

And	now	we	all	have	a	new	king.	I	wish	him,	and	you,	his	people,	happiness	and prosperity	with	all	my	heart.	God	bless	you	all.	God	Save	the	King.

'You can imagine what a bitter blow it is to me that all my struggle to win peace has failed, 1 cannot believe that there is anything more, or anything different, that [ could have done and that would have been more successful. long yet

Neville Chamberlain

## Neville	Chamberlain

## British	statesman

Arthur	Neville	Chamberlain	(1869-1940)	became	British	prime	minister	in 1937.	For	the	sake	of	peace,	and	with	the	country	unprepared	for	war,	in September	1938	he	signed	the	Munich	Agreement	with	German	Chancellor Adolf	Hitler,	afterwards	claiming	to	have	found	'peace	in	our	time'.	Having meanwhile	pressed	on	with	rearmament,	he	declared	war	in	1939.	Criticism	of his	war	leadership	accompanied	initial	military	reverses,	and	in	1940	he	yielded the	premiership	to	Winston	Churchill.
