## 'This	is	a	time	for	action'

2	November	1956,	television	and	radio	broadcast	from	London,	England

This	address	to	the	British	public	was	an	attempt	by	Eden	-	by	now	prime minister	-	to	justify	military	intervention	in	Egypt	during	the	Suez	Crisis. What	makes	the	speech	remarkable,	however,	is	what	he	chose	not	to	say. The	crisis	began	when	the	Egyptian	president,	Gamal	Abdel	Nasser, nationalized	the	Suez	Canal,	previously	controlled	by	British	and	French companies.	Britain	and	France,	fearful	that	Nasser	might	prevent	oil shipments	reaching	Europe,	made	a	secret	agreement	with	Israel.	Four	days before	Eden's	address,	Israeli	troops	invaded	Egypt	and	took	control	of	the Canal	Zone.

Claiming	no	prior	knowledge	of	the	invasion,	Eden	announces	plans	to	send British	forces	to	police	a	ceasefire	between	the	Israeli	and	Egyptian	sides.	In the	process,	of	course,	Britain	would	retake	the	Suez	Canal.	In	conciliatory tones	-	designed	to	appease	a	country	divided	over	the	affair	-	he	argues	that intervention	was	necessary	to	prevent	a	'forest	fire'	in	the	Middle	East	from spreading.	He	also	reiterates	the	Labour	leader	Hugh	Gaitskell's	comparison of	Nasser	to	Adolf	Hitler	and	Benito	Mussolini,	an	appeal	to	the	patriotism of	a	Britain	that	had	fought	and	won	World	War	II	in	the	previous	decade. On	5	and	6	November,	British	and	French	forces	began	their	occupation	of the	Canal	Zone,	but	-	in	response	to	US	diplomacy	over	the	threat	of	Soviet intervention	-	they	withdrew	in	December	to	let	a	UN	peacekeeping	force take	over.

Good	evening.	I	know	that	you	would	wish	me,	as	prime	minister,	to	talk	to you	tonight	on	the	problem	which	is	in	everybody's	mind;	and	to	tell	you	what has	happened,	what	the	government	has	done,	and	why	it	has	done	it…

## First	-	the	background.

For	ten	years	there	has	been	fighting	and	trouble	and	turmoil	in	the	Middle	East. Again	and	again	passions	have	come	to	the	boil.	There	have	been	raids	and counter	raids,	and	shooting	and	more	shooting.	Ever	since	the	uneasy	armistice of	1949	-	Israel	and	the	Arab	states	-	Egypt	has	been	insisting	ever	since	then that	she	is	still	at	war	with	Israel.	Again	and	again	the	United	Nations	has	tried to	bring	settlement	and	peace,	but	with	the	best	will	in	the	world	it's	failed.	And all	the	time,	Heaven	knows,	this	country	has	worked	tirelessly	for	agreement.

We've	tried,	for	example,	to	prove	our	desire	for	friendship	with	Egypt.	We made	an	agreement	and	withdrew	from	the	Canal	Zone.	We	made	another agreement	with	Egypt	about	the	Sudan.	We	hoped	that	these	would	lead	to	a	new spirit	in	our	relations	with	Egypt.	Some	people	say	we've	gone	much	too	far	in conciliation;	that	we	gave	up	too	much;	that	we've	been	weak	where	we	should have	been	strong.

Well,	be	that	as	it	may,	we've	certainly	gone	to	the	limit	in	our	efforts	for friendship.	All	those	friendly	approaches	have	failed.	It's	no	use	blinking	that fact.	You've	only	to	read	the	Egyptian	government's	own	statement	-	what	it intends	to	do.	Its	words	-	not	mine.	Let	me	give	you	two	examples.	The	first refers	to	Israel.	'There	will	be	no	stability	until	this	small	but	vile	state	is	stifled.' A	second	example	comes	nearer	home.	'We	must	not	in	any	circumstances	lose sight	of	our	goal:	to	fight	the	British	serpent	and	to	expel	it	utterly	from	our lands'	-	and	'lands',	of	course,	means	the	whole	of	the	Middle	East.	That's	been the	Egyptian	mood.	The	Egyptian	threat	-	openly	and	publicly	proclaimed.

But	deeds	speak	even	louder	than	words.	We've	seen	the	purchase	of	arms	from behind	the	Iron	Curtain; 1 	and	in	early	August	-	when	Colonel	Nasser	seized	the canal	-	Mr	Gaitskell 2 	called	the	threats	to	Israel	'clear	notice	of	aggression	to come'.	He	went	on	to	say:	'It's	all	very	familiar	-	it's	exactly	the	same	as	we encountered	from	Mussolini	and	Hitler	in	those	years	before	the	war.'	Strong words	-	but	justified.	No	wonder	Israel	was	worried.

Then,	a	few	days	ago,	came	the	entry	of	Israeli	troops	into	Egypt.	Was	that	a dangerous	situation?	Was	it	likely	to	lead	to	a	widespread	flare-up	in	the	Middle East?	In	the	judgement	of	the	government,	it	was.	Was	it	likely	to	endanger widespread	British	and	international	interests?	It	was.

Well,	it's	possible	to	go	on	arguing	who	was	the	aggressor.

Was	it	Israel	because	she	crossed	the	frontier?	Or	was	it	Egypt	for	what	she'd done	before?	But	that's	not	the	real	issue	for	us.	If	you	see	afar,	the	first	question isn't	how	it	started,	but	how	to	put	it	out.	The	hard	and	inescapable	fact	was	that here	was	a	situation	likely	to	inflame	the	whole	Middle	East,	with	all	that	this would	mean.	That,	in	the	government's	view,	was	the	fact	of	the	situation	-	a grim,	hard	fact.	A	reality	which	no	words	could	alter.

As	a	government	we've	had	to	wrestle	with	the	problem	of	what	action	we should	take,	so	have	our	French	friends.	The	burden	of	that	decision	was tremendous,	but	inescapable.	In	the	depths	of	our	conviction	we	decided	that here	was	the	beginning	of	a	forest	fire,	of	immense	danger	to	peace.	We	decided that	we	must	act	and	act	quickly.

What	should	we	do?	We	put	the	matter	to	the	Security	Council.	Should	we	have left	it	to	them?	Should	we	have	been	content	to	wait	to	see	whether	they	would act?	How	long	would	this	have	taken?…

We	acted	swiftly,	and	reported	to	the	Security	Council,	and	I	believe	that	before long	it	will	become	apparent	to	everybody	that	we	acted	rightly	and	wisely.

Our	friends	inside	the	Commonwealth	and	outside	couldn't,	in	the	very	nature	of things,	be	consulted	in	time.	You	just	cannot	have	immediate	action	and extensive	consultation	as	well.	But	our	friends	are	coming…to	see	that	we	acted with	courage	and	speed,	to	deal	with	a	situation	which	just	could	not	wait.

There	are	two	things	I	would	ask	you	not	to	forget.	Never	to	forget.

We	cannot	allow	-	we	could	not	allow	-	a	conflict	in	the

## Middle	East	to	spread;	our	survival	as	a	nation	depends on	oil	and	nearly	three-quarters	of	our	oil	comes	from that	part	of	the	world.

As	a	Labour	Member	of	Parliament,	speaking	in	support	of	the	government,	put it,	'to	be	without	oil'	-	I	quote	him	-	'to	be	without	oil,	is	to	see	our	industries grind	to	a	standstill,	and	starvation	overtake	the	people.'…

The	other	reflection	is	this.	It's	a	personal	one.	All	my	life	I've	been	a	man	of peace,	working	for	peace,	striving	for	peace,	negotiating	for	peace.	I've	been	a League	of	Nations	man	and	a	United	Nations	man,	and	I'm	still	the	same	man, with	the	same	conviction,	the	same	devotion	to	peace.	I	couldn't	be	other	-	even if	I	wished,	but	I'm	utterly	convinced	that	the	action	we	have	taken	is	right….

There	are	times	for	courage,	times	for	action.	And	this	is	one	of	them

In	the	interests	of	peace,	I	do	hope	we've	learnt	our	lesson.	Our	passionate	love of	peace,	our	intense	loathing	of	war	have	often	held	us	back	from	using	force, even	at	times	when	we	knew	in	our	heads,	if	not	in	our	hearts,	that	its	use	was	in the	interests	of	peace.	And	I	believe	with	all	my	heart,	and	head	-	for	both	are needed	-	that	this	is	a	time	for	action,	effective	and	swift.	Yes,	even	by	the	use of	some	force	in	order	to	prevent	the	forest	fire	from	spreading;	to	prevent	the horror	and	devastation	of	a	larger	war…

We	learn	that	the	Israeli	forces	have	captured	the	Egyptian	army	in	Sinai.	We learn	too,	that	[the]	United	Nations	truce	organization	is	trying	to	arrange	contact between	the	two	sides	to	establish	terms	of	surrender.	We	hope	that	this organization	will	be	able	to	arrange	for	all	the	captured	Egyptians	to	return	to Egypt.	We	shall	certainly	give	them	all	the	help	we	can	in	this.

It	seems	that	Israel	has	succeeded	in	destroying	the	bases	in	Sinai	and	Gaza,	in which	Egyptian	commando	raiders	were	trained	for	attacks	on	Israel.	Once British	and	French	forces	have	occupied	the	key	points	on	the	canal,	Her Majesty's	government	will	ensure	that	the	Israeli	forces	withdraw	from	Egyptian territory.

I've	no	doubt	that	is	their	intention,	but	they	will	not	do	so	unless	we	are	there	to keep	the	peace,	to	give	the	necessary	guarantees	and	prevent	a	repetition	of	these events.

So	finally,	my	friends,	what	are	we	seeking	to	do?	First	and	foremost,	to	stop	the fighting,	to	separate	the	armies,	and	to	make	sure	that	there's	no	more	fighting. We've	stepped	in	because	United	Nations	couldn't	do	so	in	time.	If	the	United Nations	will	take	over	this	police	action	we	shall	welcome	it.	Indeed	we proposed	that	course	to	them.	And	police	action	means	not	only	to	end	the fighting	now,	but	also	to	bring	a	lasting	peace	to	an	area	which	for	ten	years	has lived,	or	tried	to	live,	under	the	constant	threat	of	war.

Until	there	are	United	Nations	forces	there,	ready	to	take	over,

## …we	and	the	French	must	go	on	with	the	job,	until	the job	is	done.

All	this	could	mean	-	let's	hope	and	pray	it	does	-	that	the	outcome	will	be	not only	peace	in	the	Middle	East,	but	a	strengthened	United	Nations,	one	with power	to	act	as	well	as	to	talk	-	a	real	force	for	peace	in	the	world.

Good	night	to	you	all.

The dilemma of our age, with its infinite possibilities of selfdestruction, is how to grow out of the world of armaments into a world of international security, based on law

Hammarskjöld Dag

## Dag	Hammarskjöld

Swedish	statesman

Dag	Hjalmar	Agne	Carl	Hammarskjöld	(1905-61)	was	Swedish	Foreign Minister	(1951-3)	and	became	Secretary-General	of	the	United	Nations	in	1953. Hammarskjöld,	who	once	described	himself	as	'the	curator	of	the	secrets	of	82 nations',	played	a	leading	part	in	the	setting	up	of	the	UN	Emergency	Force	in Sinai	and	Gaza	in	1956,	and	worked	for	conciliation	in	the	Middle	East	(19578).	He	died	in	an	air	crash	near	Ndola	in	Zambia	in	1961	-	some	claim	as	the result	of	an	assassination	plot	-	and	was	awarded	the	Nobel	Peace	Prize posthumously	in	1961.
