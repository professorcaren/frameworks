## 'Apartheid's	final	solution'

11	December	1984,	Oslo,	Norway

Well	known	as	an	outspoken	critic	of	South	African	apartheid,	Archbishop Tutu	was	awarded	the	Nobel	Peace	Prize	in	1984.	He	used	this	acceptance speech	to	condemn	South	Africa's	'racist	dream',	and	to	scorn	the	limited concessions	of	the	country's	new	constitution,	introduced	the	previous	year.

Nelson	Mandela	(who	would	receive	the	Nobel	Peace	Prize	in	1993)	once remarked	of	his	ally:	'Sometimes	strident,	often	tender,	never	afraid	and seldom	without	humour,	Desmond	Tutu's	voice	will	always	be	the	voice	of the	voiceless.'

Presenting	the	award,	Egil	Aarvik,	chairman	of	the	Norwegian	Nobel Committee,	spoke	of	Tutu's	determination	that	peace	should	triumph	over violence.	He	recalled	seeing	an	example	of	Tutu's	ministry	during	television coverage	of	a	massacre	in	Johannesburg:	'After	the	police	vehicles	had driven	away	with	their	prisoners,	Desmond	Tutu	stood	and	spoke	to	a frightened	and	bitter	congregation:	'Do	not	hate,'	he	said.	'Let	us	choose	the peaceful	way	to	freedom.''

Nonetheless,	Tutu	is	a	forceful	speaker.	Having	described	individual	cases and	their	tragic	consequences	for	both	black	and	white	South	Africans,	he turns	briefly	lyrical,	before	dissecting	the	iniquities	of	apartheid.

## I	come	from	a	beautiful	land,	richly	endowed	by	God with	wonderful	natural	resources,	wide	expanses, rolling	mountains,	singing	birds,	bright	shining	stars out	of	blue	skies…

with	radiant	sunshine,	golden	sunshine.	There	is	enough	of	the	good	things	that come	from	God's	bounty,	there	is	enough	for	everyone,	but	apartheid	has confirmed	some	in	their	selfishness,	causing	them	to	grasp	greedily	a disproportionate	share,	the	lion's	share,	because	of	their	power.

They	have	taken	87	per	cent	of	the	land,	though	being	only	about	20	per	cent	of our	population.	The	rest	have	had	to	make	do	with	the	remaining	13	per	cent. Apartheid 1 	has	decreed	the	politics	of	exclusion.	Seventy-three	per	cent	of	the population	is	excluded	from	any	meaningful	participation	in	the	political decision-making	processes	of	the	land	of	their	birth.

The	new	constitution 2 …perpetuates	by	law	and	entrenches	white	minority	rule. Blacks	are	expected	to	exercise	their	political	ambitions	in	unviable,	povertystricken,	arid,	bantustan 3 homelands,	ghettoes	of	misery,	inexhaustible	reservoirs of	cheap	black	labour,	bantustans	into	which	South	Africa	is	being	Balkanized.

Blacks	are	systematically	being	stripped	of	their	South	African	citizenship	and being	turned	into	aliens	in	the	land	of	their	birth.

This	is	apartheid's	final	solution,	just	as	Nazism	had	its	final	solution	for	the Jews	in	Hitler's	Aryan	madness.	The	South	African	government	is	smart.	Aliens can	claim	but	very	few	rights,	least	of	all	political	rights.

In	pursuance	of	apartheid's	ideological	racist	dream,	over	three	million	of	God's children	have	been	uprooted	from	their	homes,	which	have	been	demolished, whilst	they	have	then	been	dumped	in	the	bantustan	homeland	resettlement camps.	I	say	dumped	advisedly:	only	things	or	rubbish	is	dumped,	not	human beings.	Apartheid	has,	however,	ensured	that	God's	children,	just	because	they are	black,	should	be	treated	as	if	they	were	things,	and	not	as	of	infinite	value	as being	created	in	the	image	of	God.

These	dumping	grounds	are	far	from	where	work	and	food	can	be	procured easily.	Children	starve,	suffer	from	the	often	irreversible	consequences	of malnutrition	-	this	happens	to	them	not	accidentally,	but	by	deliberate government	policy.	They	starve	in	a	land	that	could	be	the	bread	basket	of Africa,	a	land	that	normally	is	a	net	exporter	of	food.

The	father	leaves	his	family	in	the	bantustan	homeland,	there	eking	out	a miserable	existence,	whilst	he,	if	he	is	lucky,	goes	to	the	so-called	white	man's town	as	a	migrant,	to	live	an	unnatural	life	in	a	single-sex	hostel	for	11	months of	the	year,	being	prey	there	to	prostitution,	drunkenness	and	worse.

This	migratory	labour	policy	is	declared	government	policy,	and	has	been condemned…as	a	cancer	in	our	society.

## This	cancer,	eating	away	at	the	vitals	of	black	family life,	is	deliberate	government	policy.	It	is	part	of	the	cost of	apartheid,	exorbitant	in	terms	of	human	suffering.

Apartheid	has	spawned	discriminatory	education,	such	as	Bantu	Education, education	for	serfdom,	ensuring	that	the	government	spends	only	about	onetenth	on	one	black	child	per	annum	for	education	what	it	spends	on	a	white child.	It	is	education	that	is	decidedly	separate	and	unequal.	It	is	wantonly wasteful	of	human	resources,	because	so	many	of	God's	children	are	prevented, by	deliberate	government	policy,	from	attaining	to	their	fullest	potential…

Apartheid	is	upheld	by	a	phalanx	of	iniquitous	laws,	such	as	the	Population Registration	Act,	which	decrees	that	all	South	Africans	must	be	classified ethnically	and	duly	registered	according	to	these	race	categories.	Many	times,	in the	same	family	one	child	has	been	classified	white	whilst	another,	with	a slightly	darker	hue,	has	been	classified	coloured,	with	all	the	horrible consequences	for	the	latter	of	being	shut	out	from	membership	of	a	greatly privileged	caste.	There	have,	as	a	result,	been	several	child	suicides.

This	is	too	high	a	price	to	pay	for	racial	purity,	for	it	is	doubtful	whether	any end,	however	desirable,	can	justify	such	a	means.	There	are	laws	such	as	the Prohibition	of	Mixed	Marriages	Act,	which	regard	marriages	between	a	white and	a	person	of	another	race	as	illegal.	Race	becomes	an	impediment	to	a	valid marriage.	Two	persons	who	have	fallen	in	love	are	prevented	by	race	from consummating	their	love	in	the	marriage	bond.	Something	beautiful	is	made	to be	sordid	and	ugly…

There	are	the	laws	which	permit	the	indefinite	detention	of	persons	whom	the Minister	of	Law	and	Order	has	decided	are	a	threat	to	the	security	of	the	state. They	are	detained	at	his	pleasure,	in	solitary	confinement,	without	access	to	their family,	their	own	doctor	or	a	lawyer.	That	is	severe	punishment	when	the evidence	apparently	available	to	the	minister	has	not	been	tested	in	an	open	court -	perhaps	it	could	stand	up	to	such	rigorous	scrutiny,	perhaps	not;	we	are	never to	know.

It	is	a	far	too	convenient	device	for	a	repressive	regime,	and	the	minister	would have	to	be	extra-special	not	to	succumb	to	the	temptation	to	circumvent	the awkward	process	of	testing	his	evidence	in	an	open	court,	and	thus	he	lets	his power	under	the	law	to	be	open	to	the	abuse	where	he	is	both	judge	and prosecutor.	Many	-	too	many	-	have	died	mysteriously	in	detention.	All	this	is too	costly	in	terms	of	human	lives.

The	minister	is	able,	too,	to	place	people	under	banning	orders	without	being subjected	to	the	annoyance	of	the	checks	and	balances	of	due	process.	A	banned person	for	three	or	five	years	becomes	a	non-person,	who	cannot	be	quoted during	the	period	of	her	banning	order.	She	cannot	attend	a	gathering,	which means	more	than	one	other	person.	Two	persons	together	talking	to	a	banned person	are	a	gathering!	She	cannot	attend	the	wedding	or	funeral	of	even	her own	child	without	special	permission.	She	must	be	at	home	from	6pm	of	one	day to	6am	of	the	next	and	on	all	public	holidays,	and	from	6pm	on	Fridays	until 6am	on	Mondays	for	three	years.	She	cannot	go	on	holiday	outside	the magisterial	area	to	which	she	has	been	confined.	She	cannot	go	to	the	cinema, nor	to	a	picnic.

That	is	severe	punishment,	inflicted	without	the	evidence	allegedly	justifying	it being	made	available	to	the	banned	person,	nor	having	it	scrutinized	in	a	court	of law.	It	is	a	serious	erosion	and	violation	of	basic	human	rights,	of	which	blacks have	precious	few	in	the	land	of	their	birth.	They	do	not	enjoy	the	rights	of freedom	of	movement	and	association.	They	do	not	enjoy	freedom	of	security	of tenure,	the	right	to	participate	in	the	making	of	decisions	that	affect	their	lives.	In short,	this	land,	richly	endowed	in	so	many	ways,	is	sadly	lacking	in	justice.

Once	a	Zambian	and	a	South	African,	it	is	said,	were	talking.	The	Zambian	then boasted	about	their	Minister	of	Naval	Affairs.	The	South	African	asked,	'But you	have	no	navy,	no	access	to	the	sea.	How	then	can	you	have	a	Minister	of Naval	Affairs?'	The	Zambian	retorted,	'Well,	in	South	Africa	you	have	a Minister	of	Justice,	don't	you?'

It	is	against	this	system	that	our	people	have	sought	to	protest	peacefully	since 1912	at	least,	with	the	founding	of	the	African	National	Congress. 4 	They	have used	the	conventional	methods	of	peaceful	protest	-	petitions,	demonstrations, deputations,	and	even	a	passive	resistance	campaign.	A	tribute	to	our	people's commitment	to	peaceful	change	is	the	fact	that	the	only	South	Africans	to	win the	Nobel	Peace	Prize	are	both	black. 5

Our	people	are	peace-loving	to	a	fault.	The	response	of	the	authorities	has	been an	escalating	intransigence	and	violence,	the	violence	of	police	dogs,	tear	gas, detention	without	trial,	exile	and	even	death.	Our	people	protested	peacefully against	the	Pass	Laws 6 	in	1960,	and	69	of	them	were	killed	on	March	21,1960,	at Sharpeville,	many	shot	in	the	back	running	away. 7

Our	children	protested	against	inferior	education,	singing	songs	and	displaying placards	and	marching	peacefully.	Many	in	1976,	on	June	16	and	subsequent times,	were	killed	or	imprisoned. 8

Over	500	people	died	in	that	uprising.	Many	children	went	into	exile.	The whereabouts	of	many	are	unknown	to	their	parents…

There	has	been	little	revulsion	or	outrage	at	this	wanton	destruction	of	human life	in	the	West.	In	parenthesis,	can	somebody	please	explain	to	me	something that	has	puzzled	me?	When	a	priest	goes	missing	and	is	subsequently	found dead,	the	media	in	the	West	carry	his	story	in	very	extensive	coverage. 9 	I	am glad	that	the	death	of	one	person	can	cause	so	much	concern.	But	in	the	selfsame	week	when	this	priest	is	found	dead,	the	South	African	Police	kill	24 blacks	who	had	been	participating	in	the	protest,	and	6,000	blacks	are	sacked	for being	similarly	involved,	and	you	are	lucky	to	get	that	much	coverage.

Are	we	being	told	something	I	do	not	want	to	believe	-	that	we	blacks	are expendable	and	that	blood	is	thicker	than	water;	that	when	it	comes	to	the crunch,	you	cannot	trust	whites,	that	they	will	club	together	against	us?	I	don't want	to	believe	that	is	the	message	being	conveyed	to	us.

Be	that	as	it	may,	we	see	before	us	a	land	bereft	of	much	justice,	and	therefore without	peace	and	security.	Unrest	is	endemic,	and	will	remain	an	unchanging feature	of	the	South	African	scene	until	apartheid,	the	root	cause	of	it	all,	is

## finally	dismantled.

At	this	time,	the	army	is	being	quartered	on	the	civilian	population.	There	is	a civil	war	being	waged.	South	Africans	are	on	either	side.	When	the	African National	Congress	and	the	Pan-Africanist	Congress 10 	were	banned	in	1960,	they declared	that	they	had	no	option	but	to	carry	out	the	armed	struggle.	We	in	the South	African	Council	of	Churches	have	said	we	are	opposed	to	all	forms	of violence	-	that	of	a	repressive	and	unjust	system,	and	that	of	those	who	seek	to overthrow	that	system.	However,	we	have	added	that	we	understand	those	who say	they	have	had	to	adopt	what	is	a	last	resort	for	them…

I	have	spoken	extensively	about	South	Africa,	first	because	it	is	the	land	I	know best;	but	because	it	is	also	a	microcosm	of	the	world	and	an	example	of	what	is to	be	found	in	other	lands	in	differing	degree…Because	there	is	global insecurity,	nations	are	engaged	in	a	mad	arms	race,	spending	billions	of	dollars wastefully	on	instruments	of	destruction,	when	millions	are	starving.	And	yet, just	a	fraction	of	what	is	expended	so	obscenely	on	defence	budgets	would	make the	difference	in	enabling	God's	children	to	fill	their	stomachs,	be	educated,	and given	the	chance	to	lead	fulfilled	and	happy	lives.	We	have	the	capacity	to	feed ourselves	several	times	over,	but	we	are	daily	haunted	by	the	spectacle	of	the gaunt	dregs	of	humanity	shuffling	along	in	endless	queues,	with	bowls	to	collect what	the	charity	of	the	world	has	provided,	too	little	too	late.

## When	will	we	learn?	When	will	the	people	of	the	world get	up	and	say,	'Enough	is	enough'?

God	created	us	for	fellowship.	God	created	us	so	that	we	should	form	the	human family,	existing	together	because	we	were	made	for	one	another.	We	are	not made	for	an	exclusive	self-sufficiency	but	for	interdependence,	and	we	break	the law	of	our	being	at	our	peril…

Unless	we	work	assiduously	so	that	all	of	God's	children,	our	brothers	and sisters,	members	of	our	one	human	family,	all	will	enjoy	basic	human	rights,	the right	to	a	fulfilled	life,	the	right	of	movement,	of	work,	the	freedom	to	be	fully human,	with	a	humanity	measured	by	nothing	less	than	the	humanity	of	Jesus Christ	Himself,	then	we	are	on	the	road	inexorably	to	self-destruction;	we	are	not far	from	global	suicide	-	and	yet	it	could	be	so	different.

When	will	we	learn	that	human	beings	are	of	infinite	value	because	they	have been	created	in	the	image	of	God,	and	that	it	is	a	blasphemy	to	treat	them	as	if they	were	less	than	this,	and	to	do	so	ultimately	recoils	on	those	who	do	this?	In dehumanizing	others,	they	are	themselves	dehumanized.	Perhaps	oppression dehumanizes	the	oppressor	as	much	as,	if	not	more	than,	the	oppressed.	They need	each	other	to	become	truly	free,	to	become	human…

Let	us	work	to	be	peacemakers,	those	given	a	wonderful	share	in	Our	Lord's ministry	of	reconciliation.	If	we	want	peace,	so	we	have	been	told,	let	us	work for	justice.

## Let	us	beat	our	swords	into	ploughshares. 11

God	calls	us	to	be	fellow	workers	with	Him,	so	that	we	can	extend	his	kingdom of	shalom, 12 of	justice,	of	goodness,	of	compassion,	of	caring,	of	sharing,	of laughter,	joy	and	reconciliation,	so	that	the	kingdoms	of	this	world	will	become the	Kingdom	of	our	God	and	of	his	Christ,	and	he	shall	reign	for	ever	and	ever. Amen.
