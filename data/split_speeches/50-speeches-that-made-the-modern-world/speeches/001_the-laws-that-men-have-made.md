## 'The	laws	that	men	have	made'

24	March	1908,	London,	England

Formed	in	1887	from	17	separate	groups,	the	National	Union	of	Women's Suffrage	Societies	had	campaigned	persistently	but	unsuccessfully	to	gain the	vote	for	women.	A	growing	sense	of	frustration	drove	Emmeline	and	her daughter	Christabel	Pankhurst	to	form	breakaway	groups:	the	Women's Social	and	Political	Union	in	1903	and	the	more	militant	Women's	Freedom League	in	1907.

Tactics	pursued	by	members	of	these	organizations	included	heckling political	speeches	and	provoking	the	police	to	arrest	them	for	disturbing	the peace.	Their	activities	attracted	the	desired	attention,	though	they	were	also delightedly	lampooned	by	cartoonists	and	mainstream	newspapers.	In	1907, the	law	was	changed	to	allow	women	ratepayers	to	vote	in	local	elections	but	this	did	not	satisfy	Pankhurst.

In	1908,	she	gave	a	series	of	lectures	under	the	umbrella	title The	Importance of	the	Vote .	This	one	was	given	in	the	Portman	Rooms	during	the	Putney	byelection	of	that	year,	which	added	urgency	to	its	message.	In	her	bald	but patiently	reasoned	attack	on	the	status	quo,	Pankhurst	recites	men's legislative	shortcomings,	condemning	them	for	their	failure	to	improve ordinary	women's	lives.

What	I	am	going	to	say	to	you	tonight	is	not	new.	It	is	what	we	have	been saying	at	every	street	corner,	at	every	by-election	during	the	last	18	months.	It	is perfectly	well	known	to	many	members	of	my	audience,	but	they	will	not	mind if	I	repeat,	for	the	benefit	of	those	who	are	here	for	the	first	time	tonight,	those arguments	and	illustrations	with	which	many	of	us	are	so	very	familiar.

## In	the	first	place,	it	is	important	that	women	should have	the	vote	in	order	that	in	the	government	of	the country	the	women's	point	of	view	should	be	put forward.

It	is	important	for	women	that	in	any	legislation	that	affects	women	equally	with men,	those	who	make	the	laws	should	be	responsible	to	women,	in	order	that they	may	be	forced	to	consult	women	and	learn	women's	views	when	they	are contemplating	the	making	or	the	altering	of	laws.

Very	little	has	been	done	by	legislation	for	women	for	many	years	-	for	obvious reasons.	More	and	more	of	the	time	of	Members	of	Parliament	is	occupied	by the	claims	which	are	made	on	behalf	of	the	people	who	are	organized	in	various ways	in	order	to	promote	the	interests	of	their	industrial	organizations	or	their political	or	social	organizations.	So	the	Member	of	Parliament,	if	he	does	dimly realize	that	women	have	needs,	has	no	time	to	attend	to	them,	no	time	to	give	to the	consideration	of	those	needs.	His	time	is	fully	taken	up	by	attending	to	the needs	of	the	people	who	have	sent	him	to	Parliament.

While	a	great	deal	has	been	done,	and	a	great	deal	more	has	been	talked	about for	the	benefit	of	the	workers	who	have	votes,	yet	so	far	as	women	are concerned,	legislation	relating	to	them	has	been	practically	at	a	standstill.	Yet	it is	not	because	women	have	no	need,	or	because	their	need	is	not	very	urgent. There	are	many	laws	on	the	statute-book	today	which	are	admittedly	out	of	date, and	call	for	reformation;	laws	which	inflict	very	grave	injustices	on	women.	I want	to	call	the	attention	of	women	who	are	here	tonight	to	a	few	acts	on	the statute-book	which	press	very	hardly	and	very	injuriously	on	women.

Men	politicians	are	in	the	habit	of	talking	to	women	as	if	there	were	no	laws	that affect	women.	'The	fact	is,'	they	say,	'the	home	is	the	place	for	women.	Their interests	are	the	rearing	and	training	of	children.	These	are	the	things	that	interest women.	Politics	have	nothing	to	do	with	these	things,	and	therefore	politics	do not	concern	women.'	Yet	the	laws	decide	how	women	are	to	live	in	marriage, how	their	children	are	to	be	trained	and	educated,	and	what	the	future	of	their children	is	to	be.	All	that	is	decided	by	act	of	Parliament.	Let	us	take	a	few	of these	laws,	and	see	what	there	is	to	say	about	them	from	the	women's	point	of view.

First	of	all,	let	us	take	the	marriage	laws.	They	are	made	by	men	for	women.	Let us	consider	whether	they	are	equal,	whether	they	are	just,	whether	they	are	wise. What	security	of	maintenance	has	the	married	woman?	Many	a	married	woman, having	given	up	her	economic	independence	in	order	to	marry,	how	is	she compensated	for	that	loss?	What	security	does	she	get	in	that	marriage	for	which she	gave	up	economic	independence?	Take	the	case	of	a	woman	who	has	been earning	a	good	income.	She	is	told	that	she	ought	to	give	up	her	employment when	she	becomes	a	wife	and	a	mother.	What	does	she	get	in	return?

All	that	a	married	man	is	obliged	by	law	to	do	for	his	wife	is	to	provide	for	her shelter	of	some	kind,	food	of	some	kind	and	clothing	of	some	kind.	It	is	left	to his	good	pleasure	to	decide	what	the	shelter	shall	be,	what	the	food	shall	be, what	the	clothing	shall	be.	It	is	left	to	him	to	decide	what	money	shall	be	spent on	the	home,	and	how	it	shall	be	spent;	the	wife	has	no	voice	legally	in	deciding any	of	these	things.	She	has	no	legal	claim	upon	any	definite	portion	of	his income.	If	he	is	a	good	man,	a	conscientious	man,	he	does	the	right	thing.	If	he	is not,	if	he	chooses	almost	to	starve	his	wife,	she	has	no	remedy.	What	he	thinks sufficient	is	what	she	has	to	be	content	with.

I	quite	agree,	in	all	these	illustrations,	that	the	majority	of	men	are	considerably better	than	the	law	compels	them	to	be…but	since	there	are	some	bad	men,	some unjust	men,	don't	you	agree	with	me	that	the	law	ought	to	be	altered	so	that those	men	could	be	dealt	with?

Take	what	happens	to	the	woman	if	her	husband	dies	and	leaves	her	a	widow, sometimes	with	little	children.	If	a	man	is	so	insensible	to	his	duties	as	a	husband and	father	when	he	makes	his	will,	as	to	leave	all	his	property	away	from	his wife	and	children,	the	law	allows	him	to	do	it.	That	will	is	a	valid	one.	So	you see	that	the	married	woman's	position	is	not	a	secure	one.	It	depends	entirely	on her	getting	a	good	ticket	in	the	lottery.	If	she	has	a	good	husband,	well	and	good: if	she	has	a	bad	one,	she	has	to	suffer,	and	she	has	no	remedy.	That	is	her position	as	a	wife,	and	it	is	far	from	satisfactory.

Now	let	us	look	at	her	position	if	she	has	been	very	unfortunate	in	marriage,	so unfortunate	as	to	get	a	bad	husband,	an	immoral	husband,	a	vicious	husband,	a husband	unfit	to	be	the	father	of	little	children.	We	turn	to	the	divorce	court.

How	is	she	to	get	rid	of	such	a	man?	If	a	man	has	got	married	to	a	bad	wife,	and he	wants	to	get	rid	of	her,	he	has	but	to	prove	against	her	one	act	of	infidelity. But	if	a	woman	who	is	married	to	a	vicious	husband	wants	to	get	rid	of	him,	not one	act	nor	a	thousand	acts	of	infidelity	entitle	her	to	a	divorce.	She	must	prove either	bigamy,	desertion	or	gross	cruelty,	in	addition	to	immorality,	before	she can	get	rid	of	that	man.

Let	us	consider	her	position	as	a	mother.	We	have	repeated	this	so	often	at	our meetings	that	I	think	the	echo	of	what	we	have	said	must	have	reached	many.

By	English	law,	no	married	woman	exists	as	the	mother	of	the	child	she	brings into	the	world.	In	the	eyes	of	the	law	she	is	not	the	parent	of	her	child.

The	child,	according	to	our	marriage	laws,	has	only	one	parent	who	can	decide the	future	of	the	child,	who	can	decide	where	it	shall	live,	how	it	shall	live,	how much	shall	be	spent	upon	it,	how	it	shall	be	educated	and	what	religion	it	shall profess.	That	parent	is	the	father.

These	are	examples	of	some	of	the	laws	that	men	have	made,	laws	that	concern women.	I	ask	you,	if	women	had	had	the	vote,	should	we	have	had	such	laws?	If women	had	had	the	vote,	as	men	have	the	vote,	we	should	have	had	equal	laws. We	should	have	had	equal	laws	for	divorce,	and	the	law	would	have	said	that	as nature	has	given	to	children	two	parents,	so	the	law	should	recognize	that	they have	two	parents.

I	have	spoken	to	you	about	the	position	of	the	married	woman	who	does	not exist	legally	as	a	parent,	the	parent	of	her	own	child.	In	marriage,	children	have one	parent.	Out	of	marriage	children	have	also	one	parent.	That	parent	is	the mother	-	the	unfortunate	mother.	She	alone	is	responsible	for	the	future	of	her child;	she	alone	is	punished	if	her	child	is	neglected	and	suffers	from	neglect.

But	let	me	give	you	one	illustration.	I	was	in	Herefordshire	during	the	byelection.	While	I	was	there,	an	unmarried	mother	was	brought	before	the	bench of	magistrates,	charged	with	having	neglected	her	illegitimate	child.	She	was	a domestic	servant,	and	had	put	the	child	out	to	nurse.	The	magistrates	-	there were	colonels	and	landowners	on	that	bench	-	did	not	ask	what	wages	the mother	got;	they	did	not	ask	who	the	father	was	or	whether	he	contributed	to	the support	of	the	child.	They	sent	that	woman	to	prison	for	three	months	for	having neglected	her	child.

I	ask	you	women	here	tonight:	if	women	had	had	some	share	in	the	making	of laws,	don't	you	think	they	would	have	found	a	way	of	making	all	fathers	of	such children	equally	responsible	with	the	mothers	for	the	welfare	of	those	children?

## …The	man	voter	and	the	man	legislator	see	the	man's needs	first,	and	do	not	see	the	woman's	needs.	And	so	it will	be	until	women	get	the	vote.

It	is	well	to	remember	that,	in	view	of	what	we	have	been	told	of	what	is	the value	of	women's	influence.	Woman's	influence	is	only	effective	when	men want	to	do	the	thing	that	her	influence	is	supporting.

Now	let	us	look	a	little	to	the	future.	If	it	ever	was	important	for	women	to	have the	vote,	it	is	ten	times	more	important	today,	because	you	cannot	take	up	a newspaper,	you	cannot	go	to	a	conference,	you	cannot	even	go	to	church, without	hearing	a	great	deal	of	talk	about	social	reform	and	a	demand	for	social legislation.	Of	course,	it	is	obvious	that	that	kind	of	legislation	-	and	the	Liberal government	tell	us	that	if	they	remain	in	office	long	enough	we	are	going	to	have a	great	deal	of	it	-	is	of	vital	importance	to	women.

If	we	have	the	right	kind	of	social	legislation	it	will	be	a	very	good	thing	for women	and	children.	If	we	have	the	wrong	kind	of	social	legislation,	we	may have	the	worst	kind	of	tyranny	that	women	have	ever	known	since	the	world began.	We	are	hearing	about	legislation	to	decide	what	kind	of	homes	people	are to	live	in.	That	surely	is	a	question	for	women.	Surely	every	woman,	when	she seriously	thinks	about	it,	will	wonder	how	men	by	themselves	can	have	the audacity	to	think	that	they	can	say	what	homes	ought	to	be	without	consulting women.

Then	take	education.	Since	1870	men	have	been	trying	to	find	out	how	to educate	children. 1 I	think	they	have	not	yet	realized	that	if	they	are	ever	to	find out	how	to	educate	children,	they	will	have	to	take	women	into	their	confidence, and	try	to	learn	from	women	some	of	those	lessons	that	the	long	experience	of ages	has	taught	to	them.	One	cannot	wonder	that	whole	sessions	of	Parliament should	be	wasted	on	education	bills…

The	more	one	thinks	about	the	importance	of	the	vote	for	women,	the	more	one realizes	how	vital	it	is.	We	are	finding	out	new	reasons	for	the	vote,	new	needs for	the	vote	every	day	in	carrying	on	our	agitation.

I	hope	that	there	may	be	a	few	men	and	women	here	who	will	go	away determined	at	least	to	give	this	question	more	consideration	than	they	have	in	the past.	They	will	see	that	we	women,	who	are	doing	so	much	to	get	the	vote,	want it	because	we	realize	how	much	good	we	can	do	with	it	when	we	have	got	it.	We do	not	want	it	in	order	to	boast	of	how	much	we	have	got.	We	do	not	want	it because	we	want	to	imitate	men	or	to	be	like	men.	We	want	it	because	without	it we	cannot	do	that	work	which	it	is	necessary	and	right	and	proper	that	every man	and	woman	should	be	ready	and	willing	to	undertake	in	the	interests	of	the community	of	which	they	form	a	part.

## Vladimir	Ilich	Lenin

## Russian	revolutionary	leader

Shrewd,	dynamic,	pedantic	and	implacable,	the	Marxist	political	activist Vladimir	Ilich	Lenin	(1870-1924)	spearheaded	the	October	Revolution	of	1917 and	inaugurated	the	'dictatorship	of	the	proletariat'	that	was	to	rule	Russia	for more	than	seven	decades.	Despite	the	ultimate	failure	of	Soviet	communism,	his influence	endures	in	Russia	and	beyond.
