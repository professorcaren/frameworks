## 'You	voted	for	our	tomorrow	to	be	better	than	our yesterday'

15	March	2016,	West	Palm	Beach,	Florida

This	speech	was	given	by	a	hoarse	but	buoyant	presidential	candidate enjoying	an	early	taste	of	success.	The	occasion	was	her	victory	in	three 'primaries'	-	part	of	the	selection	process	for	the	Democratic	Party's candidate	-	and	her	anticipated	victory	in	two	others.	Beaming,	triumphant and	clad	in	blue	-	the	colour	of	the	Democrats	-	she	addressed	a	large	and voluble	crowd	of	her	supporters.	Confident	of	a	rapturous	response,	she	used simple	hand	gestures,	rhythm	and	emphasis	to	cue	their	cheers.

Like	many	seasoned	speakers,	she	adopts	a	'rule	of	three'	structure, identifying	the	three	key	challenges	facing	the	next	president.	The	first	is making	positive	changes	-	a	theme	neatly	summarized	in	the	'tomorrow better	than	yesterday'	motif.	The	second	is	national	security,	which	allows her	to	make	several	digs	at	Donald	Trump,	her	adversary	in	the	November 2016	election.	The	third	is	a	call	for	unity	-	often	deployed	by	candidates	in a	divisive	leadership	contest.

The	speech	marked	an	important	milestone	in	Clinton's	bid	to	become	the first	female	president	of	the	USA.	The	job	is	a	notoriously	challenging	one, and	throughout	her	campaign	she	presented	herself	as	tough	and	determined. On	this	occasion,	she	was	playing	to	an	easy	crowd,	but	both	content	and delivery	were	designed	to	portray	her	as	a	woman	steeled	for	combat.

Thank	you!	Thank	you	so	much!	Thank	you!	Thank	you	all	so	very	much! Well,	I'll	tell	you,	this	is	another	Super	Tuesday 1 for	our	campaign… [Cheers.]

You	voted	for	our	tomorrow	to	be	better	than	our	yesterday,	tomorrow	where	all of	us	do	our	part	and	everyone	has	a	chance	to	live	up	to	his	or	her	God-given potential. [Cheers.]

Because	that's	how	America	can	live	up	to	its	potential	too.

Now	we	need	you	to	keep	working,	keep	volunteering,	keep	contributing	at hillaryclinton.com. [Cheers.] Please,	please	join	the	950,000	supporters	who already	have	contributed	-	most	less	than	$100	-	because	our	campaign	depends on	small	donations	for	the	majority	of	our	support…

You	know,	tonight	it's	clearer	than	ever	that	this	may	be	one	of	the	most consequential	campaigns	of	our	lifetimes.	The	next	president	will	walk	into	the Oval	Office 2 	next	January,	sit	down	at	that	desk,	and	start	making	decisions	that will	affect	the	lives	and	the	livelihoods	of	everyone	in	this	country	-	indeed everyone	on	this	planet. [Cheers.]

Now	I	know,	I	know	that	easy	decisions	don't	make	it	to	the	president's	desk	only	the	hardest	choices	and	the	thorniest	problems.	I	saw	President	Obama wrestle	with	the	decision	to	send	Navy	Seals	after	Osama	bin	Laden, 3 	the decision	to	rescue	the	auto	industry, 4 to	fight	for	the	Affordable	Care	Act 5 and	so many	more.

And	so	our	next	president	has	to	be	ready	to	face	three	big	tests.	First:	can	you make	positive	differences	in	people's	lives?	Second:	can	you	keep	us	safe? Third:	can	you	bring	our	country	together	again? [Cheers.]

Now,	now	making	differences	in	people's	lives	comes	first	because	Americans everywhere	are	hungry	for	solutions.	They	want	to	break	down	the	barriers holding	them	back	so	we	can	all	rise	together.	Ask	any	parent.	You'll	hear nothing	is	more	important	than	making	sure	their	kids	have	a	good	school	and	a good	teacher,	no	matter	what	ZIP	code 6 	they	live	in.	They	deserve	a	president who	understands	that	when	we	invest	in	our	children's	education,	we're investing	in	all	of	our	futures [Cheers.] and	young	people…young	people	across America	struggling	under	the	weight	of	student	debt	find	it	difficult	to	imagine the	futures	they	want,	and	they	deserve	a	president	who	will	help	relieve	them	of that	burden	and	help	future	generations	go	to	college	without	borrowing	a	dime for	tuition. [Cheers.]

And	you	know,	grandparents…grandparents	who	worry	about	retirement deserve	a	president	who	will	protect	and	then	expand	social	security	for	those who	need	it	most	-	not	cut	or	privatise	it. [Cheers.]

Families	deserve	a	president	who	will	fight	for	the	things	that	are	priorities	at home	but	too	often	aren't	priorities	in	Washington:	affordable	childcare;	paid family	leave;	and	something	we	have	waited	for	long	enough:	equal	pay	for equal	work	for	women. [Prolonged	cheers.]

And	above	all…above	all,	hardworking	Americans	across	our	country	deserve	a president	with	both	the	ideas	and	the	know-how	to	create	good	jobs	with	rising incomes	right	here	in	our	country.	And	I	am	absolutely	convinced	that	we	have the	tools	to	do	that.	That's	why	I've	laid	out	a	programme	to	do	what	can	be done.	More	good	jobs	in	infrastructure,	more	good	jobs	in	manufacturing, [Cheers] more	good	jobs	in	small	businesses,	more	good	jobs	in	clean, renewable	energy. [Cheers.] Good-paying	jobs	are	the	ticket	to	the	middle	class and	we're	going	to	stand	up	for	the	American	middle	class	again.	We're	going	to stand	up	for	American	workers	and	make	sure	no	one	takes	advantage	of	us.	Not China,	not	Wall	Street	and	not	overpaid	corporate	executives. [Cheers.]

Now	look,	look,	of	course	every	candidate,	every	candidate	makes	promises	like this.	But	every	candidate	owes	it	to	you	to	be	clear	and	direct	about	what	our plans	will	cost	and	how	we're	going	to	make	them	work.	That's	the	difference between	running	for	president	and	being	president. [Cheers.]

And	I'll	tell	you… [interrupted	by	chants	of	'Hill-a-ry!	Hill-a-ry! ']…Let	me	tell you	that…that	the	second	big	test	for	our	next	president	is	keeping	us	safe.

We	live	in	a	complex	and,	yes,	a	dangerous	world.	Protecting	America's	national security	can	never	be	an	afterthought.	Our	commander	in	chief 7 	has	to	be	able	to defend	our	country,	not	embarrass	it. [Cheers.] Engage	our	allies,	not	alienate them.	Defeat	our	adversaries,	not	embolden	them.

When	we	hear	a	candidate	for	president	call	for	rounding	up	12	million immigrants,	banning	all	Muslims	from	entering	the	United	States…When	he embraces	torture,	that	doesn't	make	him	strong.	It	makes	him	wrong. 8 [Prolonged	cheers.]

And,	yes,	our	next	president	has	to	bring	our	country	together	so	we	can	all	share in	the	promise	of	America.	We	should	be	breaking	down	barriers,	not	building walls. 9 We're	not	going	to	succeed	by	dividing	this	country	between	us	and them.

## You	know,	to	be	great,	we	can't	be	small.

We	can't	lose	what	made	America	great	in	the	first	place,	and	this	isn't	just about	Donald	Trump.	All	of	us	have	to	do	our	part.	We	can't	just	talk	about economic	inequality,	we	have	to	take	on	all	forms	of	inequality	and discrimination.

Together,	we	have	to	defend	all	of	our	rights.	Civil	rights	and	voting	rights. Workers'	rights	and	women's	rights.	LGBT 10 	rights	and	rights	for	people	with disabilities. [Cheers.]

And	that	starts	by	standing	with	President	Obama	when	he	nominates	a	justice	to the	Supreme	Court. 11 	Our	next	president	will	face	all	these	challenges	and	more.

You	know,	running	for	president	is	hard,	but	being	president	is	harder.	It	is	the hardest,	most	important	job	in	the	world	and	no	one	person	can	succeed	at	the job	without	seeking	and	finding	common	ground	to	solve	the	problems	we	face.

If	we	work	together,	we	can	make	a	real	difference	in	people's	lives.	If	we	reach out	and	treat	each	other	with	respect,	kindness	and	even	love	instead	of	bluster and	bigotry.

[Cheers.] If	we	lift	each	other	up	instead	of	tearing	each	other	down,	there's nothing	we	can't	accomplish	together….

Eight	years	ago…eight	years	ago	on	the	night	of	the	Ohio	primary,	I	said	I	was running	for	everyone	who's	ever	been	counted	out	but	refused	to	be	knocked out,	for	everyone	who	has	stumbled	but	stood	right	back	up,	for	everyone	who works	hard	and	never	gives	up.	Well,	that	is	still	true.

Our	campaign	is	for	the	steel	worker	I	met	in	Ohio	on	Sunday	night,	who's	laid off	but	hoping	to	get	back	to	work.	It's	for	the	mother	I	met	in	Miami	whose	five children	haven't	seen	their	father	since	he	was	deported.	She	dreams	of	a	day when	deportations	end	and	families	are	reunited,	on	a	path	to	citizenship	in America. [Cheers.] And	it	is	for	the	mothers	I	stood	with	in	Chicago	yesterday who	have	lost	children	to	gun	violence.	They're	turning	their	sorrow	into	a strategy	and	their	mourning	into	a	movement.

Let's	stand	with	people	who	have	courage,	who	have	resilience.

## Let's	stand	with	everyone	who	believes	America's	best days	are	ahead	of	us.

For	all	of	our	challenges,	I've	never	had	more	faith	in	our	future	-	and	if	we work	together,	if	we	go	forward	in	this	campaign,	if	we	win	in	November,	I know	our	future	will	be	brighter	tomorrow	than	yesterday.	Thank	you	all	so	very much.
