## 'Hostility	between	the	sexes	has	never	been	worse'

January	1969,	Chicago,	Illinois,	USA

The	socio-political	ferment	spreading	throughout	the	USA	during	the	1960s saw	an	explosion	of	feminist	activity.	In The	Feminine	Mystique ,	Friedan had	described	'the	problem	that	has	no	name':	the	discontent	of	an	articulate group	of	university-educated	women	sublimating	their	own	intellectual, economic	and	emotional	lives	to	live	vicariously	through	their	husbands	and children.

This	was	also	a	time	of	post-war	conservatism,	when	abortion	was	illegal and	reliable	contraception	was	not	readily	available,	even	to	married	women. At	the	first	national	conference	on	abortion	law,	which	laid	the	foundation for	the	National	Association	for	the	Repeal	of	Abortion	Laws,	Friedan	gave this	address,	which	she	entitled,	'A	Woman's	Civil	Right'.

Her	closely	argued	speech	is	forceful	but	not	hectoring,	advancing	the hypothesis	that	a	sexual	revolution,	leading	to	absolute	equality	between	men and	women,	was	impossible	unless	women	were	able	to	control	their	own reproductive	lives.	Integral	to	this	was	a	'woman's	right	to	choose'	-	a phrase	she	may	have	coined.

Friedan	later	attempted	to	have	women's	right	to	control	their	own	fertility enshrined	in	the	Constitution.	Proposed	in	1971,	the	Equal	Rights

Amendment	would	have	ended	discrimination	based	on	gender.	It	was approved	by	both	houses	of	Congress,	but	failed	to	be	ratified	by	threequarters	of	the	states	and	was	thus	narrowly	defeated.

This	is	the	first	decent	conference	that's	ever	been	held	on	abortion,	because this	is	the	first	conference	in	which	women's	voices	are	being	heard	and	heard strongly…

## Only	one	voice	needs	to	be	heard	on	the	question	of whether	a	woman	will	or	will	not	bear	a	child,	and	that is	the	voice	of	the	woman	herself…

her	own	conscience,	her	own	conscious	choice.	Then,	and	only	then,	will	women move	out	of	their	definition	as	sex	objects	to	personhood	and	selfdetermination…

Yesterday,	an	obscene	thing	happened	in	the	city	of	New	York.	A	Committee	of the	State	Legislature	held	hearings	on	the	question	of	abortion.	Women	like	me asked	to	testify.	We	were	told	that	testimony	was	by	invitation	only.	Only	one woman	was	invited	to	testify	on	the	question	of	abortion	in	the	state	of	New York	-	a	Catholic	nun.

The	only	other	voices	were	those	of	men.	It	is	obscene	that	men,	whether	they	be legislators	or	priests	or	even	benevolent	abortion	reformers,	should	be	the	only ones	heard	on	the	question	of	women's	bodies	and	there	productive	process,	on what	happens	to	the	people	that	actually	bear	the	children	in	this	society.

The	right	of	woman	to	control	her	reproductive	process	must	be	established	as	a basic,	inalienable,	civil	right,	not	to	be	denied	or	abridged	by	the	state	-	just	as the	right	of	individual	and	religious	conscience	is	considered	an	inalienable private	right	in	both	American	tradition	and	in	the	American	constitution.

This	is	how	we	must	address	all	questions	governing	abortion,	access	to	birth control,	and	contraceptive	devices.	Don't	talk	to	me	about	abortion	reform. Abortion	reform	is	something	dreamed	up	by	men,	maybe	good-hearted	men, but	they	can	only	think	from	their	male	point	of	view…What	right	have	they	to say?	What	right	has	any	man	to	say	to	any	woman	-	you	must	bear	this	child? What	right	has	any	state	to	say?	This	is	a	woman's	right,	not	a	technical	question needing	the	sanction	of	the	state,	or	to	be	debated	in	terms	of	technicalities	- they	are	all	irrelevant.

This	question	can	only	be	confronted	in	terms	of	the	basic	personhood	and dignity	of	woman,	which	is	violated	for	ever	if	she	does	not	have	the	right	to control	her	own	reproductive	process.

It	is	quite	remarkable	what	has	happened	in	the	little	more	than	a	year	during which	some	of	us	have	begun	to	talk	about	abortion	in	these	terms…New	York State	was	having	a	constitutional	convention	and	Larry	Lader 1 	invited	me	to	the meeting	of	all	the	different	groups…who	were	working	on	abortion	reform.

I	said,	we're	going	into	the	New	York	State	constitutional	convention demanding	a	Bill	of	Rights	for	women,	and	we	are	going	to	demand	that	it	be written	into	the	Constitution	that	the	right	of	a	woman	to	control	her reproductive	process	must	be	established	as	a	civil	right,	a	right	not	to	be	denied or	abridged	by	the	state.	Most	of	the	people	at	that	table,	people	working	on abortion	reform,	were	men.	They	looked	at	me	in	absolute	horror,	as	if	I	was	out of	my	mind…

If	I	were	easily	intimidated,	I	would	have	slunk	out.	But	I	said,	well,	you	may	be right	but	as	far	as	we	are	concerned,	this	is	the	only	way	that	abortion	is	worth talking	about;	we're	going	to	demand	it	and	let's	see	what	happens.	As	I	left,	a couple	of	the	women	who	were	sitting	quietly	at	the	table	came	up	and	said, 'We'd	like	to	help.'	Then,	lo	and	behold,	I	began	to	hear	ministers	and	ADA 2 and	ACLU 3 	and	others	begin	to	voice	the	same	position,	in	terms	of	woman's basic	right…

## Women,	even	though	they're	almost	too	visible	as	sex objects	in	this	country,	are	invisible	people.

As	the	negro	was	the	invisible	man,	so	women	are	the	invisible	people	who	have a	share	in	the	decisions	of	the	mainstream	of	government,	of	politics,	of	the church	-	who	don't	just	cook	the	church	supper,	but	preach	the	sermon;	who don't	just	look	up	the	ZIP	codes 4 	and	address	the	envelopes,	but	make	the political	decisions;	who	don't	just	do	the	housework	of	industry,	but	make	some of	the	executive	decisions.	Women,	above	all,	who	say	what	their	own	lives	and personalities	are	going	to	be,	and	no	longer	listen	to	or	even	permit	male	experts to	define	what	'feminine'	is	or	isn't.

The	essence	of	the	denigration	of	women	is	our	definition	as	sex	object…Am	I

saying	that	women	must	be	liberated	from	sex?	No.	I	am	saying	that	sex	will only	be	liberated	to	be	a	human	dialogue,	sex	will	only	cease	to	be	a	sniggering, dirty	joke	and	an	obsession	in	this	society,	when	women	become	active	selfdetermining	people,	liberated	to	a	creativity	beyond	motherhood,	to	a	full	human creativity.

Am	I	saying	that	women	must	be	liberated	from	motherhood?	No.	I	am	saying that	motherhood	will	only	be	a	joyous	and	responsible	human	act	when	women are	free	to	make,	with	full	conscious	choice	and	full	human	responsibility,	the decisions	to	become	mothers.	Then,	and	only	then,	will	they	be	able	to	embrace motherhood	without	conflict,	when	they	will	be	able	to	define	themselves	not just	as	somebody's	mother,	not	just	as	servants	of	children,	not	just	as	breeding receptacles,	but	as	people	for	whom	motherhood	is	a	freely	chosen	part	of	life… Then,	and	only	then,	will	motherhood	cease	to	be	a	curse	and	a	chain	for	men and	for	children.

The	hostility	between	the	sexes	has	never	been	worse.	The	image	of	women	in avant-garde	plays,	novels	and	movies,	and	behind	the	family	situation	comedies on	television	is	that	mothers	are	man-devouring,	cannibalistic	monsters,	or	else Lolitas, 	sex	objects	-	and	objects	not	even	of	heterosexual	impulse,	but	of	sado5 masochism.	That	impulse	-	the	punishment	of	women	-	is	much	more	of	a	factor in	the	abortion	question	than	anybody	ever	admits.

Motherhood	is	a	bane	almost	by	definition,	or	at	least	partly	so,	as	long	as women	are	forced	to	be	mothers	-	and	only	mothers	-	against	their	will.

Like	a	cancer	cell	living	its	life	through	another	cell,	women	today	are	forced	to live	too	much	through	their	children	and	husbands…

Perhaps	it	is	the	least	understood	fact	of	American	political	life:	the	enormous buried	violence	of	women	in	this	country	today.	Like	all	oppressed	people, women	have	been	taking	their	violence	out	on	their	own	bodies,	in	all	the maladies	with	which	they	plague	the	MDs	and	the	psychoanalysts.	Inadvertently, and	in	subtle	and	insidious	ways,	they	have	been	taking	their	violence	out,	too, on	their	children	and	on	their	husbands,	and	sometimes	they're	not	so	subtle…

Am	I	saying	that	women	have	to	be	liberated	from	men?	That	men	are	the enemy?	No.	I	am	saying	the

…men	will	only	be	truly	liberated	to	love	women	and	to

## be	fully	themselves	when	women	are	liberated	to	have	a full	say	in	the	decisions	of	their	lives	and	their	society.

Until	that	happens,	men	are	going	to	bear	the	guilty	burden	of	the	passive destiny	they	have	forced	upon	women,	the	suppressed	resentment,	the	sterility	of love	when	it	is	not	between	two	fully	active,	joyous	people,	but	has	in	it	the element	of	exploitation…

Men	have	enormous	capacities	in	them	that	they	have	to	repress	and	fear	in	order to	live	up	to	the	obsolete,	brutal,	bear-killing,	Ernest	Hemingway, 6 	crew-cut Prussian,	napalm-all-the-children-in-Vietnam,	bang-bang-you're-dead	image	of masculinity.	Men	are	not	allowed	to	admit	that	they	sometimes	are	afraid.	They are	not	allowed	to	express	their	own	sensitivity,	their	own	need	to	be	passive sometimes	and	not	always	active.	Men	are	not	allowed	to	cry.	So	they	are	only half-human,	as	women	are	only	half-human,	until	we	can	go	this	next	step forward.	All	the	burdens	and	responsibilities	that	men	are	supposed	to	shoulder alone	makes	them,	I	think,	resent	women's	pedestal,	much	as	that	pedestal	may be	a	burden	for	women.

This	is	the	real	sexual	revolution.	Not	the	cheap	headlines	in	the	papers	about	at what	age	boys	and	girls	go	to	bed	with	each	other	and	whether	they	do	it	with	or without	the	benefit	of	marriage.	That's	the	least	of	it.	The	real	sexual	revolution is	the	emergence	of	women	from	passivity,	from	the	point	where	they	are	the easiest	victims	for	all	the	seductions,	the	waste,	the	worshipping	of	false	gods	in our	affluent	society,	to	full	self-determination	and	full	dignity.	And	it	is	the emergence	of	men	from	the	stage	where	they	are	inadvertent	brutes	and	masters to	sensitive,	complete	humanity…

If	we	are	finally	allowed	to	become	full	people,	not	only	will	children	be	born and	brought	up	with	more	love	and	responsibility	than	today,	but	we	will	break out	of	the	confines	of	that	sterile	little	suburban	family	to	relate	to	each	other	in terms	of	all	the	possible	dimensions	of	our	personalities	-	male	and	female,	as comrades,	as	colleagues,	as	friends,	as	lovers…

It's	crucial,	therefore,	that	we	see	this	question	of	abortion	as	more	than	a quantitative	move,	more	than	a	politically	expedient	move.

Abortion	repeal	is	not	a	question	of	political	expediency.	It	is	part	of	something greater.	It	is	historic	that	we	are	addressing	ourselves	this	weekend	to	perhaps	its first	national	confrontation	by	women	and	men…

In	this	confrontation,	we	are	making	an	important	milestone	in	this	marvellous revolution	that	began	long	before	any	of	us	here	were	born	and	which	still	has	a long	way	to	go.	As	the	pioneers	from	Mary	Wollstonecraft 7 	to	Margaret	Sanger 8 gave	us	the	consciousness	that	brought	us	from	our	several	directions	here,	so	we here	-	in	changing	the	very	terms	of	the	debate	on	abortion	to	assert	woman's right	to	choose	and	to	define	the	terms	of	our	lives	ourselves	-	move	women further	to	full	human	dignity.	Today,	we	moved	history	forward…

Edward	Richard	George	Heath	also	called	Ted	Heath,	later	Sir	Edward	Heath (1916-2005),	entered	Parliament	in	1950,	one	of	R	A	Butler's	'One	Nation'	new Tory	intellectuals.	Elected	leader	of	the	Conservative	Party	in	July	1965,	he	led the	opposition	until,	on	winning	the	1970	general	election,	he	became	prime minister.	At	the	beginning	of	1973,	the	UK	finally	became	a	member	of	the European	Community,	which	Heath	considered	his	crowning	achievement.	After a	long	confrontation	with	the	miners'	union	in	1973,	the	Conservatives	narrowly lost	the	general	election	of	February	1974,	the	loss	being	confirmed	by	another election	in	October	1974.	In	1975,	he	was	replaced	as	leader	by	Margaret Thatcher.
