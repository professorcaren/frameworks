## 'Iraq	will	be	victorious'

20	March	2003,	Baghdad,	Iraq

Following	the	terrorist	attacks	of	11	September	2001	in	the	USA,	American fears	of	overseas	threats	were	heightened	and	the	anti-American	rhetoric	of Saddam	reinforced	a	perception	of	his	regime	as	a	sponsor	of	international terrorism.	His	continued	obstruction	of	the	work	of	UN	weapons	inspection teams	hardened	international	attitudes	towards	him	and	strengthened	calls	for President	George	W	Bush	to	complete	his	father's	'unfinished	business'. Allied	forces	were	assembled	on	Iraq's	borders	in	the	early	months	of	2003 and	US	bombers	struck	Baghdad	on	20	March.

Saddam	appeared	on	Iraqi	television	two	hours	after	these	initial 'decapitation'	bombings,	which	announced	the	onset	of	the	expected	war.

Wearing	military	uniform	-	and	citing	the	date,	to	prove	that	the	speech	had not	been	pre-recorded	and	that	he	was	still	in	control	-	Saddam	conceded	no suggestion	of	defeat,	despite	the	overwhelming	odds.

The	fierce	defiance,	pious	religious	language	and	promises	of	humiliation	for the	enemy	are	all	characteristic	features	of	his	bullish	oratorical	style.

In	the	name	of	God,	the	merciful,	the	compassionate…Those	who	are oppressed	are	permitted	to	fight	and	God	is	capable	of	making	them	victorious. God	is	greatest.

To	the	great	people	of	Iraq,	to	our	brave	strugglers,	to	our	men	in	the	heroic armed	forces,	to	our	glorious	nation:	at	dawn	prayers	today	on	20	March	2003, the	criminal,	reckless	little	Bush	and	his	aides	committed	this	crime	which	he was	threatening	to	commit	against	Iraq	and	humanity.	He	executed	his	criminal act	with	his	allies;	thereby	he	and	his	followers	have	added	to	the	series	of shameful	crimes	committed	against	Iraq	and	humanity.

## To	the	Iraqis	and	the	good	people	of	our	nation:	your country,	your	glorious	nation	and	your	principles	are worth	the	sacrifices	of	yourself,	your	souls,	your	family and	your	sons.

In	this	context,	I	don't	need	to	repeat	to	you	what	each	and	every	one	of	you must	and	needs	to	do	to	defend	our	precious	nation,	our	principles	and	sanctities. I	say	to	every	single	member	of	the	patient	and	faithful	Iraqi	family	which	is oppressed	by	the	evil	enemy	to	remember	and	not	to	forget	everything	that	he has	said	and	pledged.	These	days,	and	according	to	God's	will,	will	add	to	the eternal	history	of	glorious	Iraq.

You	brave	men	and	women	of	Iraq:	you	deserve	victory	and	glory	and everything	that	elevates	the	stature	of	the	faithful	before	their	God	and	defeats the	infidels,	enemies	of	God	and	humanity	at	large.	You,	Iraqis,	will	be victorious	along	with	the	sons	of	the	nation.	You	are	already	victorious,	with	the help	of	God.	Your	enemies	will	be	in	disgrace	and	shame…

To	you	friends,	opposed	to	the	evil	in	the	world,	peace	upon	you.	Now	that	you have	seen	how	the	reckless	Bush	belittled	your	positions	and	views	against	the war	and	your	sincere	call	for	peace,	he	has	committed	his	despicable	crime today…

They	will	be	defeated,	a	defeat	that	is	wished	for	them	by	the	good,	faithful	and lovers	of	peace	and	humanity.	Iraq	will	be	victorious,	God	willing,	and	with	Iraq our	nation	and	humanity	will	be	victorious	and	the	evil	ones	will	be	hit	in	a	way that	will	make	them	unable	to	achieve	their	crime	in	the	way	that	they,	the American	and	Zionist	coalition,	have	planned	for	nations	and	peoples,	above	all our	glorious	Arab	nation.

God	is	greatest.	Long	live	Iraq	and	Palestine.	God	is	greatest.	Long	live	our glorious	nation;	long	live	human	brotherhood;	long	live	lovers	of	peace	and security	and	those	who	seek	the	right	of	people	to	live	in	freedom,	based	on justice.	God	is	greatest.	Long	live	Iraq;	long	live	jihad 	and	long	live	Palestine. 1 God	is	greatest.	God	is	greatest.	God	is	greatest.

it is very clear who is the one benefiting from igniting this war and from the shedding of blood. It is the warlords, the bloodsuckers, who are steering the world policy from behind a curtain '

Osama bin Laden

## Osama	bin	Laden

## Saudi	Arabian	terrorist

The	son	of	a	Yemeni-born	construction	billionaire,	Osama	bin	Mohammad	bin Laden	(1957-2011)	founded	the	al-Qaeda	organization	in	1988	to	support Islamic	opposition	movements	across	the	world.	In	1998,	he	called	upon Muslims	everywhere	to	attack	Americans	and	US	interests	and	was	strongly suspected	of	being	involved	in	various	terrorist	attacks	against	the	West.	He	rose to	global	notoriety	after	11	September	2001,	when	four	commercial	airliners were	hijacked	by	terrorists,	two	of	which	were	used	to	destroy	the	World	Trade Center	in	New	York.	In	total,	almost	3,000	people	were	killed.	Soon	afterwards, bin	Laden	was	identified	as	the	chief	culprit.	US	president	George	W	Bush responded	by	declaring	an	international	'war	on	terrorism',	organizing	assaults against	Bin	Laden's	bases	in	Afghanistan	and	against	the	Taliban	regime,	which was	accused	of	sheltering	him.	Considered	the	world's	most	wanted	criminal,	for a	decade	he	consistently	eluded	capture.	On	2	May	2011,	he	was	assassinated during	a	controversial	covert	operation	ordered	by	President	Barack	Obama	at what	seems	to	have	been	his	long-standing	home	in	Abbottabad,	Pakistan.
