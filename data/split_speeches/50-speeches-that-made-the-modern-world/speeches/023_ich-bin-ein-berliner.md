## 'Ich	bin	ein	Berliner'

26	June	1963,	West	Berlin,	West	Germany

Kennedy	left	the	USA	in	June	1963	for	a	goodwill	tour	of	five	nations	in western	Europe.	West	Germany	was	the	first	of	these	countries	and	Berlin	situated	in	East	Germany	but	divided	into	east	and	west	halves	by	the recently	built	wall	-	was	his	most	eagerly	anticipated	destination.

East	Germany	had	erected	the	wall	in	August	1961	to	prevent	skilled workers	escaping	to	the	more	prosperous	West	Germany	and	threatening	the viability	of	its	economy.	The	concrete	structure,	replete	with	watchtowers, gun	positions	and	mines,	was	over	4.5	metres	(15	feet)	high	in	parts	and	ran for	some	160	kilometres	(100	miles)	around	the	perimeter	of	West	Berlin.

A	crowd	of	120,000	cheering	Berliners	gathered	to	hear	Kennedy	speak	on the	steps	of	the	Schöneberger	Rathaus,	West	Berlin's	city	hall,	near	the	wall itself.	His	speech	later	caused	wry	smiles	since,	in	some	parts	of	Germany (although	not	Berlin), ein	Berliner is	a	type	of	doughnut.	Amusement	was the	last	thing	on	the	audience's	mind,	however:	they	regarded	Kennedy's address	as	a	major	morale	boost	and	a	message	of	defiance	to	their communist	neighbours.

I	am	proud	to	come	to	this	city	as	the	guest	of	your	distinguished	Mayor, 1 who	has	symbolized	throughout	the	world	the	fighting	spirit	of	West	Berlin.	And I	am	proud	to	visit	the	Federal	Republic	with	your	distinguished	Chancellor, 2 who	for	so	many	years	has	committed	Germany	to	democracy	and	freedom	and progress,	and	to	come	here	in	the	company	of	my	fellow	American,	General Clay, 3 who	has	been	in	this	city	during	its	great	moments	of	crisis	and	will	come again	if	ever	needed.

Two	thousand	years	ago	the	proudest	boast	was	'civis	Romanus	sum'. 4 	Today,	in the	world	of	freedom,	the	proudest	boast	is	'Ich	bin	ein	Berliner'.	I	appreciate my	interpreter	translating	my	German!

There	are	many	people	in	the	world	who	really	don't	understand,	or	say	they don't,	what	is	the	great	issue	between	the	free	world	and	the	communist	world. Let	them	come	to	Berlin.	There	are	some	who	say	that	communism	is	the	wave of	the	future.	Let	them	come	to	Berlin.	And	there	are	some	who	say,	in	Europe and	elsewhere,	we	can	work	with	the	communists.	Let	them	come	to	Berlin.	And there	are	even	a	few	who	say	that	it	is	true	that	communism	is	an	evil	system,	but it	permits	us	to	make	economic	progress.

Lass'	sie	nach	Berlin	kommen .	Let	them	come	to	Berlin.

Freedom	has	many	difficulties	and	democracy	is	not	perfect,	but	we	have	never had	to	put	a	wall	up	to	keep	our	people	in,	to	prevent	them	from	leaving	us.	I want	to	say,	on	behalf	of	my	countrymen,	who	live	many	miles	away	on	the other	side	of	the	Atlantic,	who	are	far	distant	from	you,	that	they	take	the greatest	pride	that	they	have	been	able	to	share	with	you,	even	from	a	distance, the	story	of	the	last	18	years.

I	know	of	no	town,	no	city,	that	has	been	besieged	for	18	years	that	still	lives with	the	vitality	and	the	force,	and	the	hope	and	the	determination	of	the	city	of

West	Berlin.

While	the	Wall	is	the	most	obvious	and	vivid	demonstration	of	the	failures	of	the communist	system,	for	all	the	world	to	see,	we	take	no	satisfaction	in	it,	for	it	is, as	your	Mayor	has	said,	an	offence	not	only	against	history	but	an	offence against	humanity,	separating	families,	dividing	husbands	and	wives	and	brothers and	sisters,	and	dividing	a	people	who	wish	to	be	joined	together.

What	is	true	of	this	city	is	true	of	Germany:

## …real,	lasting	peace	in	Europe	can	never	be	assured	as long	as	one	German	out	of	four	is	denied	the elementary	right	of	free	men,	and	that	is	to	make	a	free choice.

In	18	years	of	peace	and	good	faith,	this	generation	of	Germans	has	earned	the right	to	be	free,	including	the	right	to	unite	their	families	and	their	nation	in lasting	peace,	with	goodwill	to	all	people.	You	live	in	a	defended	island	of freedom,	but	your	life	is	part	of	the	main.

So	let	me	ask	you,	as	I	close,	to	lift	your	eyes	beyond	the	dangers	of	today,	to	the hopes	of	tomorrow,	beyond	the	freedom	merely	of	this	city	of	Berlin,	or	your country	of	Germany,	to	the	advance	of	freedom	everywhere,	beyond	the	Wall	to the	day	of	peace	with	justice,	beyond	yourselves	and	ourselves	to	all	mankind.

Freedom	is	indivisible,	and	when	one	man	is	enslaved,	all	are	not	free.	When	all are	free,	then	we	can	look	forward	to	that	day	when	this	city	will	be	joined	as one	and	this	country	and	this	great	continent	of	Europe	in	a	peaceful	and	hopeful globe.	When	that	day	finally	comes,	as	it	will,	the	people	of	West	Berlin	can	take sober	satisfaction	in	the	fact	that	they	were	in	the	frontlines	for	almost	two decades.

## All	free	men,	wherever	they	may	live,	are	citizens	of Berlin…

and,	therefore,	as	a	free	man,	I	take	pride	in	the	words:	'Ich	bin	ein	Berliner.'

## Martin	Luther	King

## American	clergyman	and	civil	rights	leader

Shortly	after	Martin	Luther	King,	Jr	(1929-68)	became	pastor	of	the	Dexter Avenue	Baptist	Church	in	Montgomery,	Alabama,	Rosa	Parks	(1913-2005)	was arrested	for	refusing	to	give	up	her	seat	on	a	bus	to	a	white	passenger.	This sparked	the	Montgomery	bus	boycott	(1955-6),	and	King	came	to	national prominence	as	its	eloquent	and	courageous	leader.	In	1957,	he	founded	the Southern	Christian	Leadership	Conference,	which	organized	civil	rights activities	throughout	the	country.	A	brilliant	orator,	King	galvanized	the movement	and	in	1963	led	the	March	on	Washington,	where	he	delivered	the famous	'I	have	a	dream'	speech.	Inspired	by	the	example	of	Mahatma	Gandhi, he	espoused	a	philosophy	of	non-violence	and	passive	resistance.	King's	efforts were	instrumental	in	securing	passage	of	the	Civil	Rights	Act	of	1964	and	the Voting	Rights	Act	of	1965.	He	was	assassinated	in	Memphis,	Tennessee,	while on	a	civil	rights	mission.
