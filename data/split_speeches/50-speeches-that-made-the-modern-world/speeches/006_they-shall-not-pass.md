## 'They	shall	not	pass!'

19	July	1936,	radio	broadcast	from	Madrid,	Spain

At	dawn	on	18	July	1936,	Major	General	Francisco	Franco	-	then	occupying a	command	in	the	remote	Canary	Islands	-	released	a	manifesto	in	mainland Spain,	declaring	military	rebellion	against	the	leftist	People's	Front government.	The	uprising	began	that	morning,	and	three	years	of	bloody struggle	followed.

La	Pasionaria	had	her	own	reasons	to	loathe	Franco:	as	the	daughter	of	a miner,	she	had	seen	him	put	down	the	miner-led	revolt	of	October	1934	in Asturias.	She	rightly	saw	Franco's	rebellion	as	a	calamity.

Already	well	known	as	a	journalist,	politician	and	public	speaker	particularly	popular	among	women	-	La	Pasionaria	quickly	emerged	as	the mouthpiece	of	the	Republican	cause.	This	call	to	arms,	broadcast	by	radio the	day	after	Franco's	manifesto,	was	one	of	many	rousing	speeches	she made	around	this	time,	and	her	slogan	'They	shall	not	pass!'	became	a rallying	cry	of	the	Spanish	Civil	War.

However,	her	supporters	were	doomed	to	failure.	By	1	October,	Franco	had been	declared	head	of	state,	although	it	was	April	1939	before	he	was	able	to claim	total	victory.

Workers,	anti-fascists,	and	labouring	people:	rise	as	one	man!	Prepare	to defend	the	republic,	national	freedom	and	the	democratic	liberties	won	by	the people!

Everybody	now	knows	from	the	communications	of	the	government	and	of	the People's	Front 1 	how	serious	the	situation	is.	The	workers,	together	with	the troops	which	have	remained	loyal	to	the	republic,	are	manfully	and enthusiastically	carrying	on	the	struggle	in	Morocco	and	the	Canary	Islands. 2

Under	the	slogan,	'Fascism	shall	not	pass,	the	October	butchers 3 	shall	not	pass!'

Communists,	socialists,	anarchists	and	republicans,	soldiers	and	all	the	forces loyal	to	the	will	of	the	people	are	routing	the	traitorous	rebels,	who	have trampled	in	the	mud	and	betrayed	their	vaunted	military	honour.

The	whole	country	is	shocked	by	the	actions	of	these	villains.	They	want	with fire	and	sword	to	turn	democratic	Spain,	the	Spain	of	the	people,	into	a	hell	of terrorism	and	torture.	But	they	shall	not	pass!

All	Spain	has	risen	to	the	struggle.	In	Madrid	the	people	have	come	out	into	the streets,	lending	strength	to	the	government	by	their	determination	and	fighting spirit,	so	that	it	may	utterly	exterminate	the	reactionary	fascist	rebels.

## Young	men	and	women:	sound	the	alarm!	Rise	and	join the	battle!

Women,	heroic	women	of	the	people:	remember	the	heroism	of	the	Austrian women! 4 	And	you	too	fight	side	by	side	with	your	menfolk;	together	with	them defend	the	bread	and	tranquillity	of	your	children,	whose	lives	are	in	danger!

Soldiers,	sons	of	the	people:	stand	steadfastly	as	one	man	on	the	side	of	the government,	on	the	side	of	the	working	people,	on	the	side	of	the	People's	Front, on	the	side	of	your	fathers,	brothers	and	comrades!	March	with	them	to	victory! Fight	for	the	Spain	of	16	February! 5

## Working	people	of	all	political	trends!

The	government	has	placed	valuable	means	of	defence	into	our	hands	in	order that	we	may	perform	our	duty	with	honour,	in	order	that	we	may	save	Spain from	the	disgrace	that	would	be	brought	upon	her	by	a	victory	of	the	bloodthirsty October	butchers.	Not	one	of	you	must	hesitate	for	a	single	moment,	and tomorrow	we	shall	be	able	to	celebrate	our	victory.

Be	prepared	for	action!	Every	worker,	every	anti-fascist,	must	regard	himself	as a	mobilized	soldier!

People	of	Catalonia,	the	Basque	Country	and	Galicia,	and	all	Spaniards:	rise	in the	defence	of	the	democratic	republic,	rise	to	consolidate	the	victory	won	by	the people	on	16	February!	The	Communist	Party	calls	upon	all	of	you	to	join	the struggle.	It	calls	upon	all	working	people	to	take	their	place	in	the	struggle	in order	completely	to	smash	the	enemies	of	the	republic	and	of	the	freedom	of	the people.

Long	live	the	People's	Front! Long	live	the	alliance	of	all	anti-fascists! Long	live	the	people's	republic!

## British	monarch

Edward	VIII,	later	HRH	The	Duke	of	Windsor	(1894-1972),	was	the	eldest	son of	George	V	(1865-1936).	He	succeeded	his	father	in	1936,	but	abdicated	less than	11	months	later,	prompted	by	general	disapprobation	and	constitutional difficulties	over	his	proposed	marriage	to	the	divorcee	Mrs	Wallis	Simpson.
