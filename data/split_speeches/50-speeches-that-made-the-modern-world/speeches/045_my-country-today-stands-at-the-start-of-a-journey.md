## 'My	country	today	stands	at	the	start	of	a	journey'

21	June	2012,	Westminster	Hall,	London

In	June	2012,	Aung	San	Suu	Kyi	visited	the	UK	and	four	other	European countries	during	her	first	visit	overseas	in	many	years.	She	had	been	leader of	Burma's	National	League	for	Democracy	almost	continuously	since	1988, but	only	recently	elected	as	an	MP.	On	21	June,	she	addressed	the	joint Houses	of	Commons	and	Lords	in	Westminster	Hall,	giving	this	impassioned plea	for	Britain	to	assist	her	country	as	it	struggled	to	recreate	itself	as	a parliamentary	democracy.

At	the	heart	of	her	speech	is	a	comparison	between	the	hard-won,	fledgling democracy	of	Burma	and	the	British	parliamentary	system	on	which	it	was modelled,	'perhaps	the	pre-eminent	symbol	to	oppressed	peoples	around	the world	of	freedom	of	speech'.	In	her	appeal	for	support	and	assistance,	she warns	against	complacency,	suggesting	that	many	in	the	West	take	their democracy	for	granted.

A	calm	but	undemonstrative	speaker,	she	referred	closely	to	her	notes throughout	the	speech,	and	made	few	hand	gestures	-	though	the	solemnity of	her	speech	is	leavened	with	anecdotes	and	gentle	humour.	More	than charisma	and	panache,	she	relies	on	two	factors:	the	simple,	common-sense imperatives	embedded	in	the	content	of	her	speech,	and	the	personal authority	accorded	to	her	by	much	of	the	world.

Lord	Speaker,	Mr	Speaker,	Mr	Prime	Minister, 1 	My	Lords	and	Members	of the	House	of	Commons.	Thank	you	for	inviting	me	to	speak	to	you	here	in	this magnificent	hall.	I	am	very	conscious	of	the	extraordinary	nature	of	this honour…

I	have	just	come	from	Downing	Street. 2 	It	was	my	first	visit	there,	and	yet	for	me it	was	a	familiar	scene	-	not	just	from	television	broadcasts,	but	from	my	own family	history.	As	some	of	you	may	be	aware,	the	best-known	photograph	of	my father,	Aung	San,	taken	shortly	before	his	assassination	in	1947,	was	of	him standing	in	Downing	Street	with	Clement	Attlee 3 	and	others,	with	whom	he	had been	discussing	Burma's	transition	to	independence…

A	couple	of	hours	ago	I	was	photographed	in	the	same	place	where	my	father was	photographed,	together	with	Prime	Minister	David	Cameron,	and	it	was raining.	Very	British! [Laughter.]

My	father	was	a	founding	member	of	the	Burmese	Independence	Army 4 	in World	War	II.	He	took	on	this	responsibility	out	of	a	desire	to	see	democracy established	in	his	homeland.	It	was	his	view	that	democracy	was	the	only political	system	worthy	of	an	independent	nation.	It	is	a	view	of	course	that	I have	long	shared.

General	Slim, 5 	commander	of	the	14th	Army,	who	led	the	Allied	Burmese campaign,	wrote	about	his	first	encounter	with	my	father	in	his	memoir	Defeat until	Victory.	The	meeting	came	towards	the	end	of	the	war,	shortly	after	my father	had	decided	that	the	Burmese	Independence	Army	should	join	forces	with the	Allies.	General	Slim	said	to	my	father:	'You've	only	come	to	us	because	we are	winning.'	To	which	my	father	replied,	'It	wouldn't	be	much	good	coming	to you	if	you	weren't!'	Slim	saw	in	my	father	a	practical	man	with	whom	he	could do	business.	Six	decades	later,	I	strive	to	be	as	practical	as	my	father	was.

And	so	I	am	here,	in	part,	to	ask	for	practical	help.	Help	as	a	friend	and	as	an equal.	In	support	of	the	reforms	which	can	bring	better	lives	and	greater opportunities	to	the	people	of	Burma	who	have	been	for	so	long	deprived	of	their rights	and	place	in	the	world.

As	I	said	yesterday	in	Oxford, 6 	my	country	today	stands	at	the	start	of	a	journey toward	I	hope	a	better	future.	So	many	hills	remain	to	be	climbed,	chasms	to	be bridged,	obstacles	to	be	breached.

Our	own	determination	can	get	us	so	far.	The	support	of	the	people	of	Britain and	of	peoples	around	the	world	can	get	us	so	much	further.

In	a	speech	about	change	and	reform,	it	is	very	appropriate	to	be	in	Westminster Hall,	because	at	the	heart	of	this	process	must	be	the	establishment	of	a	strong, parliamentary	institution	in	my	own	country.	The	British	Parliament	is	perhaps the	pre-eminent	symbol	to	oppressed	peoples	around	the	world	of	freedom	of speech.	I	would	imagine	that	some	people	here,	to	some	extent,	take	this freedom	for	granted.

For	us	in	Burma,	what	you	take	for	granted,	we	have	had	to	struggle	for	long	and hard.	So	many	people	in	Burma	gave	up	so	much,	gave	up	everything,	in Burma's	ongoing	struggle	for	democracy,	and	we	are	only	now	just	beginning	to see	the	fruits	of	our	struggle.

Westminster	has	long	set	a	shining	example	of	realizing	the	people's	desire	to	be part	of	their	own	legislative	process.	In	Burma	our	parliament	is	in	its	infancy, having	been	established	only	in	March	2011.	As	with	any	new	institution, especially	an	institution	which	goes	against	the	cultural	grain	of	49	years	of direct	military	rule,	it	will	take	time	to	find	its	feet	and	time	to	find	its	voice.

Our	new	legislative	processes,	which	undoubtedly	are	an	improvement	on	what has	gone	before,	are	not	as	transparent	as	they	might	be.	I	would	like	to	see	us learn	from	established	examples	of	parliamentary	democracies	elsewhere,	so	that we	might	deepen	our	own	democratic	standards	over	time.

## Perhaps	the	most	critical	moment	in	establishing	the credibility	of	the	parliamentary	process	happens	before parliament	even	opens	-	namely	the	people's participation	in	a	free,	fair,	inclusive	electoral	process.

Earlier	this	year	I	myself	participated	in	my	first	election	as	a	candidate.	To	this day,	however,	I	have	not	yet	had	the	chance	to	vote	freely	in	any	election.	In 1990	I	was	allowed	to	cast	an	advance	vote	while	under	house	arrest.

But	I	was	prevented	from	contesting	as	a	candidate	for	my	party,	the	National League	for	Democracy.	I	was	disqualified	on	the	grounds	that	I	had	received help	from	foreign	quarters.	This	amounted	to	BBC	broadcasts	that	the	authorities considered	to	be	biased	in	my	favour.	What	struck	me	most,	ahead	of	this	year's by-elections,	was	how	quickly	people	in	the	constituencies	around	Burma grasped	the	importance	of	participating	in	the	political	process.	They	understood first	hand	that	the	right	to	vote	was	not	something	given	to	all.	They	understood that	they	must	take	advantage	when	the	opportunity	arose,	because	they understood	what	it	meant	to	have	that	opportunity	taken	away	from	them…

It	has	been	less	than	100	days,	since	I,	together	with	my	fellow	National	League for	Democracy	candidates,	was	out	on	the	campaign	trail	across	Burma.	Our	byelections	were	held	on	April	1st,	and	I	was	conscious	there	was	a	certain scepticism	that	this	would	turn	out	to	be	an	elaborate	April	Fool's	joke.	In	fact,	it turned	out	to	be	an	April	of	new	hope.

The	voting	process	was	largely	free	and	fair,	and	I	would	like	to	pay	tribute	to President	Thein 7 	for	this	and	for	his	commitment	and	his	sincerity	in	the	reform process.

As	I	have	long	said,	it	is	through	dialogue	and	through	cooperation	that	political differences	can	best	be	resolved,	and	my	own	commitment	to	this	path	remains as	strong	as	ever.

Elections	in	Burma	are	very	different	to	those	in	many	more	established democracies	such	as	yours.	Apathy,	especially	among	the	young,	is	certainly	not an	issue.	For	me,	the	most	encouraging	and	rewarding	aspect	of	our	own elections	was	the	participation,	in	such	vast	numbers	and	with	such	enthusiasm, of	our	young	people.	Often,	our	biggest	challenge	was	in	restraining	the	crowds of	university	students,	schoolchildren	and	flag-waving	toddlers	who	greeted	us on	the	campaign,	blocking	the	roads	throughout	the	length	of	towns…

The	passion	of	the	electorate	was	a	passion	born	of	hunger	for	something	long denied.

Following	Burma's	independence	in	1948,	our	parliamentary	system	was	of course	based	on	that	of	the	United	Kingdom.	The	era	became	known	in	Burmese as	the	Parliamentary	Era,	a	name	which,	by	the	mere	necessity	of	its	application, speaks	of	the	unfortunate	changes	which	followed.

Our	parliamentary	era,	which	lasted	more	or	less	until	1962,	could	not	be	said	to have	been	perfect.	But	it	was	certainly	the	most	progressive	and	promising period	until	now	in	the	short	history	of	independent	Burma.	It	was	at	this	time that	Burma	was	considered	the	nation	most	likely	to	succeed	in	South-East	Asia. Things	did	not,	however,	go	entirely	to	plan.	They	often	don't	in	Burma	and indeed	in	the	rest	of	the	world.

Now,	once	again,	we	have	an	opportunity	to	re-establish	true	democracy	in Burma.	It	is	an	opportunity	for	which	we	have	waited	many	decades.	If	we	do not	use	this	opportunity,	if	we	do	not	get	things	right	this	time	around,	it	may	be several	decades	more	before	a	similar	opportunity	arises	again.

And	so	it	is	for	this	reason	that	I	would	ask	Britain,	as	one	of	the	oldest parliamentary	democracies,	to	consider	what	it	can	do	to	build	the	sound institutions	needed	to	support	our	nascent	parliamentary	democracy.

The	reforms	taking	place,	led	by	President	Thein	Sein,	are	to	be	welcomed.	But this	cannot	be	a	personality-based	process.	Without	strong	institutions,	this process	will	not	be	sustainable.	Our	legislature	has	much	to	learn	about	the democratization	process,	and	I	hope	that	Britain	and	other	democracies	can	help by	sharing	your	own	experiences	with	us…

…What	is	most	important	is	to	empower	the	people,	the	essential	ingredient	of democracy.	Britain	is	living	proof	that	a	constitution	does	not	need	to	be	written down	to	be	effective.	It	is	more	important	that	a	constitution	should	be	accepted by	the	people,	that	the	people	should	feel	it	belongs	to	them,	that	it	is	not	an external	document	imposed	on	them.

One	of	the	clearly	stated	aims	of	my	party,	the	National	League	for	Democracy, is	constitutional	reform.	Britain's 	original	constitution	was	drawn	up	following 8 the	meeting	between	my	father	Aung	San	and	Clement	Attlee	here	in	London	in 1947.	This	constitution	may	not	have	been	perfect,	but	at	its	core	was	a	profound understanding	of	and	respect	for	the	aspirations	of	the	people.

The	current	constitution,	drawn	up	by	the	military	government	in	2008,	must	be amended	to	incorporate	the	basic	rights	and	aspirations	of	Burma's	ethnic nationalities.	In	over	60	years	of	independence,	Burma	has	not	yet	known	a	time when	we	could	say	that	there	is	peace	throughout	the	land…

We	need	to	address	the	problems	that	lie	at	the	root	of	conflict.	We	need	to develop	a	culture	of	political	settlement	through	negotiation	and	to	promote	the rule	of	law,	that	all	who	live	in	Burma	may	enjoy	the	benefits	of	both	freedom and	security.

In	the	immediate	term,	we	also	need	humanitarian	support	for	the	many	peoples in	the	north	and	west,	largely	women	and	children,	who	have	been	forced	to	flee their	homes.

## As	the	long	history	of	the	United	Kingdom	shows clearly,	people	never	lose	their	need	to	preserve	their national	or	ethnic	identity.	This	is	something	which goes	beyond,	which	supersedes	economic	development.

And	that	is	why	I	hope	that	in	working	for	Burma's	national	reconciliation,	the international	community	will	recognize	that	it	is	political	dialogue	and	political settlement	which	must	be	given	precedence	over	short-term	economic development.

If	differences	remain	unresolved,	if	basic	aspirations	remain	unfulfilled,	there cannot	be	an	adequate	foundation	for	sustainable	development	of	any	kind	economic,	social	or	political.

Britain	has	for	so	long,	under	successive	governments	-	including	the	present Conservative	/	Liberal	Democratic	coalition,	and	the	previous	Labour government	-	been	a	staunch	and	unshakeable	supporter	of	aid	efforts	in	Burma. I	hope	that	you	can	continue	to	help	our	country	through	targeted	and coordinated	development	assistance.

Britain	has	been	until	now	the	largest	bilateral	donor	to	Burma.	It	is	in	education in	particular	that	I	hope	the	British	can	play	a	major	role…

Vocational	training	and	creation	of	employment	opportunities	to	help	address

Burma's	chronic	youth	unemployment	are	particularly	important.	Longer	term, Burma's	education	system	is	desperately	weak.	Reform	is	needed,	not	just	of schools	and	the	curriculum	and	the	training	of	teachers,	but	also	of	our	attitude to	education,	which	at	present	is	too	narrow	and	rigid.

I	hope	also	that	British	businesses	can	play	a	role	in	supporting	the	democratic reform	process,	through	what	I	have	termed	democracy-friendly	investment.	By this	I	mean	investment	that	prioritizes	transparency,	accountability,	workers' rights	and	environmental	sustainability.	Investment	particularly	in	labourintensive	sectors,	when	carried	out	responsibly	and	with	positive	intent,	can	offer real	benefits	to	our	people.

One	test	will	be	whether	new	players	will	benefit	from	the	investment	coming	in. Britain	has	played	an	important	role	in	facilitating	the	forthcoming	visit,	next month,	of	the	Extractive	Industries	Transparency	Initiative	Secretariat. 9 	I	hope this	will	be	the	start	of	many	similar	initiatives	in	the	months	ahead.

It	was	through	learning,	while	at	Oxford,	about	two	great	British	leaders, Gladstone 10 	and	Disraeli, 11 that	I	first	developed	my	understanding	of parliamentary	democracy.	I	learnt	the	basics:	that	one	accepts	the	decision	of	the voters;	that	the	governing	power	is	gained	and	relinquished	in	accordance	with the	desires	of	the	electorate,	that	it	is	a	system	which	goes	on,	and	that	ultimately everyone	gets	another	chance.

These	are	things	taken	for	granted	here	in	Britain,	but	in	1990	in	Burma,	the winner	of	the	elections	was	never	allowed	even	to	convene	parliament.	I	hope that	we	can	leave	such	days	behind	us,	and	that	as	we	look	forward	to	the	future, it	will	be	the	will	of	the	people	that	is	reflected	faithfully	in	Burma's	changing political	landscape.

This	journey	out	of	Burma	has	not	been	a	sentimental	pilgrimage	to	the	past,	but an	exploration	of	the	new	opportunities	at	hand	for	the	people	of	Burma.	I	have been	struck	throughout	my	trip	by	how	extraordinarily	warm-hearted	and	open the	world	has	been	to	us.

To	experience	this	first-hand,	after	so	long	physically	separated	from	the	world, has	been	very	moving.

Countries	that	geographically	are	distant	have	shown	that	they	are	close	to Burma	in	what	really	matters:	they	are	close	to	the	aspirations	of	the	people	of Burma…

During	the	years	of	my	house	arrest,	it	was	not	just	the	BBC	and	other broadcasting	stations	that	kept	me	in	touch	with	the	world	outside.	It	was	the music	of	Mozart	and	Ravi	Shankar	and	the	biographies	of	men	and	women	of different	races	and	religions	that	convinced	me	I	would	never	be	alone	in	my struggle.	The	prizes	and	honours	I	received	were	not	so	much	a	personal	tribute as	a	recognition	of	the	basic	humanity	that	unites	one	isolated	person	to	the	rest of	the	world.

During	our	dark	days	in	the	1990s,	a	friend	sent	me	a	poem	by	Arthur	Hugh Clough. 12 It	begins…'Say	not	the	struggle	nought	availeth'.	I	understand	that Winston	Churchill,	one	of	the	greatest	parliamentarians	this	world	has	known, used	this	poem	himself	as	a	plea	to	the	United	States	of	America	to	step	in against	Nazi	Germany.

Today	I	want	to	make	a	rather	different	point:	that	we	can	work	together, combining	political	wisdom	from	East	and	West	to	bring	the	light	of	democratic values	to	all	peoples	in	Burma	and	beyond…

I	would	like	to	emphasize	in	conclusion	that	this	is	the	most	important	time	for Burma;	that	this	is	the	time	of	our	greatest	need.	And	so	I	would	ask	that	our friends,	both	here	in	Britain	and	beyond,	participate	in	and	support	Burma's efforts	towards	the	establishment	of	a	truly	democratic	and	just	society.

Thank	you	for	giving	me	this	opportunity	to	address	the	members	of	one	of	the oldest	democratic	institutions	in	the	world.	Thank	you	for	letting	me	into	your midst.	My	country	has	not	entered	the	ranks	of	truly	democratic	societies,	but	I am	confident	that	we	will	get	there	before	too	long,	with	your	help.	Thank	you.

## Malala	Yousafzai

## Pakistani	activist

Malala	Yousafzai	(1997-)	was	born	in	the	Swat	Valley,	in	the	Khyber Pakhtunkhwa	province	of	northern	Pakistan.	Her	parents	were	Sunni	Muslims	of Pashtun	ethnicity,	who	ran	schools	in	the	region.	At	an	early	age,	she	emerged	as a	campaigner	for	human	rights,	particularly	in	relation	to	women	and	education. At	the	age	of	11,	she	began	writing	a	blog	for	the	BBC	about	life	in	a	region controlled	by	the	Taliban,	a	militant	Sunni	movement,	which	uses	violence	to impose	a	harsh	interpretation	of	Islamic	sharia	law,	including	the	denial	of education	to	girls.	She	featured	prominently	in Class	Dismissed, a New	York Times documentary	of	2010,	and	soon	became	widely	known,	giving	media interviews	throughout	the	world.	In	October	2012,	a	Taliban	gunman	boarded her	school	bus	and	shot	her	in	the	head.	Although	critically	injured,	she	made	a full	recovery	following	treatment	in	Birmingham,	UK,	where	she	later	returned to	attend	school.	On	12	July	2013,	her	16th	birthday,	she	was	the	keynote speaker	at	a	'Youth	Takeover'	event	held	by	the	United	Nations	in	New	York.	In 2014,	she	became	the	youngest	ever	recipient	of	the	Nobel	Peace	Prize	(jointly with	Kailash	Satyarthi).
