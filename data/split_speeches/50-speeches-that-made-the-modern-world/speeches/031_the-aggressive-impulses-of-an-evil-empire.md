## 'The	aggressive	impulses	of	an	evil	empire'

8	March	1983,	Orlando,	Florida,	USA

Among	Reagan's	priorities	when	he	came	to	power	was	the	restoration	of	the USA's	military	and	moral	pre-eminence;	to	this	end,	he	authorized	vast increases	in	defence	spending	and	pursued	a	conservative	social	agenda.

This	speech,	made	at	the	annual	convention	of	the	National	Association	of Evangelicals,	is	a	clear	reflection	of	Reagan's	main	aims:	the	first	half (omitted	here)	dealt	with	the	importance	of	Christianity	in	American	life	and discussed	sexual	morality	and	abortion;	the	second	half	dismisses	calls	for the	USA	to	freeze	its	nuclear	arsenal,	and	famously	describes	the	Soviet Union	as	an	'evil	empire'.

The	speech,	and	this	phrase	in	particular,	divided	opinion	around	the	world. The	Soviet	authorities	were	incensed	-	an	official	response	stated	that Reagan's	administration	could	'think	only	in	terms	of	confrontation	and bellicose,	lunatic	anti-communism'.	Others,	however,	thought	that	by introducing	the	notion	of	'evil'	into	the	Cold	War,	Reagan	had	claimed	the moral	high	ground	and	gained	new	confidence	for	the	USA.

Years	later,	Reagan	said	of	his	speech,	'It	was	portrayed	as	some	kind	of know-nothing,	arch-conservative	statement…[but]	the	Soviet	system	has purposely	starved,	murdered	and	brutalized	its	own	people…Is	the	system that	allowed	this	not	evil?'

During	my	first	press	conference	as	president,	in	answer	to	a	direct	question, I	pointed	out	that,	as	good	Marxist-Leninists,	the	Soviet	leaders	have	openly	and publicly	declared	that	the	only	morality	they	recognize	is	that	which	will	further their	cause,	which	is	world	revolution.	I	think	I	should	point	out	I	was	only quoting	Lenin,	their	guiding	spirit,	who	said	in	1920	that	they	repudiate	all morality	that	proceeds	from	supernatural	ideas	-	that's	their	name	for	religion	or	ideas	that	are	outside	class	conceptions.	Morality	is	entirely	subordinate	to	the interests	of	class	war.	And	everything	is	moral	that	is	necessary	for	the annihilation	of	the	old,	exploiting	social	order	and	for	uniting	the	proletariat.

Well,	I	think	the	refusal	of	many	influential	people	to	accept	this	elementary	fact of	Soviet	doctrine	illustrates	an	historical	reluctance	to	see	totalitarian	powers for	what	they	are.	We	saw	this	phenomenon	in	the	1930s.	We	see	it	too	often today.

This	doesn't	mean	we	should	isolate	ourselves	and	refuse	to	seek	an understanding	with	them.	I	intend	to	do	everything	I	can	to	persuade	them	of	our peaceful	intent,	to	remind	them	that	it	was	the	West	that	refused	to	use	its nuclear	monopoly	in	the	'40s	and	'50s	for	territorial	gain,	and	which	now proposes	a	50	per	cent	cut	in	strategic	ballistic	missiles	and	the	elimination	of	an entire	class	of	land-based,	intermediate-range	nuclear	missiles.

At	the	same	time,	however,	they	must	be	made	to	understand	we	will	never compromise	our	principles	and	standards.

…We	will	never	give	away	our	freedom.	We	will	never abandon	our	belief	in	God.

And	we	will	never	stop	searching	for	a	genuine	peace.	But	we	can	assure	none	of these	things	America	stands	for	through	the	so-called	nuclear	freeze	solutions proposed	by	some.

The	truth	is	that	a	freeze	now	would	be	a	very	dangerous	fraud,	for	that	is	merely the	illusion	of	peace.	The	reality	is	that	we	must	find	peace	through	strength.

I	would	agree	to	a	freeze	if	only	we	could	freeze	the	Soviets'	global	desires.	A freeze	at	current	levels	of	weapons	would	remove	any	incentive	for	the	Soviets to	negotiate	seriously	in	Geneva 1 	and	virtually	end	our	chances	to	achieve	the major	arms	reductions	which	we	have	proposed.	Instead,	they	would	achieve their	objectives	through	the	freeze…

A	number	of	years	ago,	I	heard	a	young	father,	a	very	prominent	young	man	in the	entertainment	world,	addressing	a	tremendous	gathering	in	California.	It	was during	the	time	of	the	Cold	War,	and	communism	and	our	own	way	of	life	were very	much	on	people's	minds.	And	he	was	speaking	to	that	subject.	And suddenly,	though,	I	heard	him	saying,	'I	love	my	little	girls	more	than	anything.'

And	I	said	to	myself,	'Oh,	no,	don't.	You	can't	-	don't	say	that.'	But	I	had underestimated	him.

He	went	on:	'I	would	rather	see	my	little	girls	die	now,	still	believing	in	God, than	have	them	grow	up	under	communism	and	one	day	die	no	longer	believing in	God.'

There	were	thousands	of	young	people	in	that	audience.	They	came	to	their	feet with	shouts	of	joy.	They	had	instantly	recognized	the	profound	truth	in	what	he had	said,	with	regard	to	the	physical	and	the	soul	and	what	was	truly	important.

Yes,	let	us	pray	for	the	salvation	of	all	of	those	who	live	in	that	totalitarian darkness	-	pray	they	will	discover	the	joy	of	knowing	God.	But	until	they	do,	let us	be	aware	that	while	they	preach	the	supremacy	of	the	state,	declare	its omnipotence	over	individual	man,	and	predict	its	eventual	domination	of	all peoples	on	the	earth,	they	are	the	focus	of	evil	in	the	modern	world.

It	was	C	S	Lewis 2 	who,	in	his	unforgettable Screwtape	Letters ,	wrote:	'The greatest	evil	is	not	done	now	in	those	sordid	'dens	of	crime'	that	Dickens	loved to	paint.	It	is	not	even	done	in	concentration	camps	and	labour	camps.	In	those we	see	its	final	result.	But	it	is	conceived	and	ordered	(moved,	seconded,	carried and	minuted)	in	clear,	carpeted,	warmed	and	well-lighted	offices,	by	quiet	men with	white	collars	and	cut	fingernails	and	smooth-shaven	cheeks	who	do	not need	to	raise	their	voices.'

Well,	because	these	'quiet	men'	do	not	'raise	their	voices',	because	they sometimes	speak	in	soothing	tones	of	brotherhood	and	peace,	because,	like	other dictators	before	them,	they're	always	making	'their	final	territorial	demand', some	would	have	us	accept	them	at	their	word	and	accommodate	ourselves	to their	aggressive	impulses.	But	if	history	teaches	anything,	it	teaches	that	simpleminded	appeasement,	or	wishful	thinking	about	our	adversaries,	is	folly.	It means	the	betrayal	of	our	past,	the	squandering	of	our	freedom.

So	I	urge	you	to	speak	out	against	those	who	would	place	the	United	States	in	a position	of	military	and	moral	inferiority.	You	know,	I've	always	believed	that old	Screwtape	reserved	his	best	efforts	for	those	of	you	in	the	church.	So,	in	your discussions	of	the	nuclear	freeze	proposals,	I	urge	you	to	beware	the	temptation of	pride	-	the	temptation	of	blithely	declaring	yourselves	above	it	all	and labelling	both	sides	equally	at	fault,	to	ignore	the	facts	of	history	and	the aggressive	impulses	of	an	evil	empire,	to	simply	call	the	arms	race	a	giant misunderstanding	and	thereby	remove	yourself	from	the	struggle	between	right and	wrong	and	good	and	evil.

I	ask	you	to	resist	the	attempts	of	those	who	would	have	you	withhold	your support	for	our	efforts,	this	administration's	efforts,	to	keep	America	strong	and free,	while	we	negotiate	real	and	verifiable	reductions	in	the	world's	nuclear arsenals	and	one	day,	with	God's	help,	their	total	elimination.

While	America's	military	strength	is	important,	let	me	add	here	that	I've	always maintained	that	the	struggle	now	going	on	for	the	world	will	never	be	decided	by bombs	or	rockets,	by	armies	or	military	might.	The	real	crisis	we	face	today	is	a spiritual	one;	at	root,	it	is	a	test	of	moral	will	and	faith.

Whittaker	Chambers,	the	man	whose	own	religious	conversion	made	him	a witness	to	one	of	the	terrible	traumas	of	our	time,	the	Hiss-Chambers	case, 3 wrote	that	the	crisis	of	the	Western	world	exists	to	the	degree	in	which	the	West is	indifferent	to	God,	the	degree	to	which	it	collaborates	in	communism's attempt	to	make	man	stand	alone	without	God.	And	then	he	said,	for	MarxismLeninism	is	actually	the	second	oldest	faith,	first	proclaimed	in	the	Garden	of Eden	with	the	words	of	temptation,	'Ye	shall	be	as	gods'. 4 …

I	believe	we	shall	rise	to	the	challenge.	I	believe	that	communism	is	another	sad, bizarre	chapter	in	human	history	whose	last	pages	even	now	are	being	written.	I believe	this	because	the	source	of	our	strength	in	the	quest	for	human	freedom	is not	material,	but	spiritual.	And	because	it	knows	no	limitation,	it	must	terrify	and ultimately	triumph	over	those	who	would	enslave	their	fellow	man.

## We	have	it	in	our	power	to	begin	the	world	over	again.

For	in	the	words	of	Isaiah:	'He	giveth	power	to	the	faint;	and	to	them	that	have no	might	he	increaseth	strength…But	they	that	wait	upon	the	Lord	shall	renew their	strength;	they	shall	mount	up	with	wings	as	eagles;	they	shall	run,	and	not be	weary…' 5

Yes,	change	your	world.	One	of	our	Founding	Fathers,	Thomas	Paine,	said,	'We have	it	within	our	power	to	begin	the	world	over	again.' 6 	We	can	do	it,	doing together	what	no	one	church	could	do	by	itself.

God	bless	you,	and	thank	you	very	much.

## Desmond	Tutu

## South	African	clergyman

After	working	as	a	schoolteacher	for	about	four	years	Desmond	Mpilo	Tutu (1931-)	attended	theological	college	and	became	an	Anglican	parish	priest (1961).	He	rose	rapidly	to	become	Bishop	of	Lesotho	(1976-8),	SecretaryGeneral	of	the	South	African	Council	of	Churches	(1978-85),	the	first	black Bishop	of	Johannesburg	(1985-6)	and	Archbishop	of	Cape	Town	(1986-96).	A fierce	opponent	of	apartheid,	he	repeatedly	risked	imprisonment	for	his advocacy	of	punitive	international	sanctions	against	South	Africa,	although	he deplored	the	use	of	violence.	He	was	awarded	the	Nobel	Peace	Prize	in	1984, was	appointed	Chancellor	of	the	University	of	the	Western	Cape	in	Cape	Town in	1988,	and	chaired	the	post-apartheid	Truth	and	Reconciliation	Commission, 1995-9.
