## 'Vietnam	has	the	right	to	be	a	free	and	independent country'

2	September	1945,	Hanoi,	Vietnam

Ho	Chi	Minh's	opportunistic	declaration	of	Vietnamese	independence	was	a direct	result	of	World	War	II.	As	part	of	Indochina,	the	country	had	been	a valued	French	colony	since	1868,	but	Japan	invaded	in	1940	and	France	was forced	to	recognize	Japanese	rule,	in	return	for	nominal	sovereignty.

With	American	support,	Ho's	Viet	Minh	Independence	League	waged	a guerrilla	war	against	the	Japanese	occupiers.	In	March	1945,	fearing	an American	invasion,	the	Japanese	ousted	France's	nominal	colonial	rulers, installing	the	Vietnamese	emperor	Bao	Dai	(1913-97)	as	their	puppet	ruler. Five	months	later,	Japan	surrendered,	Bao	Dai	abdicated,	and	the	Viet	Minh gained	effective	control	over	much	of	Vietnam.

On	2	September	1945,	Japan	signed	the	surrender	agreement	ending	World War	II.	Ho	seized	his	opportunity	to	declare	Vietnam's	independence,	which he	announced	in	this	speech,	given	at	Ba	Dinh	Square	in	Hanoi.

Ho	Chi	Minh	begins	by	quoting	from	the	American	Declaration	of Independence,	of	which	he	had	been	given	a	copy	by	his	allies	in	US	military intelligence.	Denouncing	the	economic	enslavement	of	Vietnam	by	France, he	then	proclaims	the	formation	of	the	Democratic	Republic	of	Vietnam.

'All	men	are	created	equal.	They	are	endowed	by	their	Creator	with	certain unalienable	rights;	among	these	are	life,	liberty,	and	the	pursuit	of	happiness.'

This	immortal	statement	was	made	in	the	Declaration	of	Independence	of	the United	States	of	America	in	1776.	In	a	broader	sense,	this	means:	all	the	peoples on	the	earth	are	equal	from	birth;	all	the	peoples	have	a	right	to	live,	to	be	happy and	free.

The	declaration	of	the	French	Revolution,	made	in	1791,	on	the	rights	of	man and	the	citizen	also	states:	'All	men	are	born	free	and	with	equal	rights,	and	must always	remain	free	and	have	equal	rights.' 1 	These	are	undeniable	truths.

Nevertheless,	for	more	than	80	years,	the	French	imperialists,	abusing	the standard	of	liberty,	equality,	and	fraternity,	have	violated	our	fatherland	and oppressed	our	fellow	citizens.	They	have	acted	contrary	to	the	ideals	of humanity	and	justice.

In	the	field	of	politics,	they	have	deprived	our	people	of	every	democratic liberty…

In	the	field	of	economics,	they	have	fleeced	us	to	the	backbone,	impoverished our	people	and	devastated	our	land…

In	the	autumn	of	1940,	when	the	Japanese	fascists	violated	Indochina's	territory to	establish	new	bases	in	their	fight	against	the	Allies,	the	French	imperialists went	down	on	their	bended	knees	and	handed	over	our	country	to	them.

Thus,	from	that	date,	our	people	were	subjected	to	the	double	yoke	of	the	French and	the	Japanese.	Their	sufferings	and	miseries	increased.	The	result	was	that, from	the	end	of	last	year	to	the	beginning	of	this	year,	from	Quang	Tri	Province to	the	north	of	Vietnam,	more	than	two	million	of	our	fellow	citizens	died	from starvation.

On	March	9	[1945],	the	French	troops	were	disarmed	by	the	Japanese.	The French	colonialists	either	fled	or	surrendered,	showing	that	not	only	were	they incapable	of	'protecting'	us,	but	that,	in	the	span	of	five	years,	they	had	twice sold	our	country	to	the	Japanese.

On	several	occasions	before	March	9,	the	Viet	Minh	League	urged	the	French	to ally	themselves	with	it	against	the	Japanese.	Instead	of	agreeing	to	this	proposal, the	French	colonialists	so	intensified	their	terrorist	activities	against	the	Viet Minh	members,	that	before	fleeing	they	massacred	a	great	number	of	our political	prisoners	detained	at	Yen	Bay	and	Cao	Bang.

Notwithstanding	all	this,	our	fellow	citizens	have	always	manifested	toward	the French	a	tolerant	and	humane	attitude.	Even	after	the	Japanese	putsch	of	March 1945,	the	Viet	Minh	League	helped	many	Frenchmen	to	cross	the	frontier, rescued	some	of	them	from	Japanese	jails,	and	protected	French	lives	and property.

In	the	autumn	of	1940,	our	country	had	in	fact	ceased	to	be	a	French	colony	and had	become	a	Japanese	possession.

After	the	Japanese	had	surrendered	to	the	Allies,	our	whole	people	rose	to	regain our	national	sovereignty	and	to	found	the	Democratic	Republic	of	Vietnam.	The truth	is	that	we	have	wrested	our	independence	from	the	Japanese	and	not	from the	French.

The	French	have	fled,	the	Japanese	have	capitulated,	Emperor	Bao	Dai	has abdicated.	Our	people	have	broken	the	chains	which	for	nearly	a	century	have fettered	them	and	have	won	independence	for	the	fatherland.	Our	people	at	the same	time	have	overthrown	the	monarchic	regime	that	has	reigned	supreme	for dozens	of	centuries.	In	its	place	has	been	established	the	present	democratic republic.

For	these	reasons,	we,	members	of	the	provisional	government,	representing	the whole	Vietnamese	people,	declare	that	from	now	on	we	break	off	all	relations	of a	colonial	character	with	France;	we	repeal	all	the	international	obligations	that France	has	so	far	subscribed	to	on	behalf	of	Vietnam,	and	we	abolish	all	the special	rights	the	French	have	unlawfully	acquired	in	our	fatherland.

The	whole	Vietnamese	people,	animated	by	a	common	purpose,	are	determined to	fight	to	the	bitter	end	against	any	attempt	by	the	French	colonialists	to reconquer	their	country.	We	are	convinced	that	the	Allied	nations,	which	at Teheran 2 	and	San	Francisco 3 	have	acknowledged	the	principles	of	selfdetermination	and	equality	of	nations,	will	not	refuse	to	acknowledge	the independence	of	Vietnam.

A	people	who	have	courageously	opposed	French	domination	for	more	than	80 years,	a	people	who	have	fought	side	by	side	with	the	Allies	against	the	fascists during	these	last	years,	such	a	people	must	be	free	and	independent.

For	these	reasons,

…we,	members	of	the	provisional	government	of	the Democratic	Republic	of	Vietnam,	solemnly	declare	to the	world	that	Vietnam	has	the	right	to	be	a	free	and independent	country…

-	and	in	fact	it	is	so	already.	The	entire	Vietnamese	people	are	determined	to mobilize	all	their	physical	and	mental	strength,	to	sacrifice	their	lives	and property	in	order	to	safeguard	their	independence	and	liberty.
