## 'AIDS	virus	is	not	a	political	creature'

19	August	1992,	Houston,	Texas,	USA

In	the	summer	of	1991,	television	producer	Mary	Fisher	was	diagnosed	with HIV,	the	virus	that	causes	AIDS.	After	seven	months	of	deliberation	-	during which	she	struggled	with	despair	and	alcohol	abuse	-	she	decided	to	make her	condition	public,	and	to	devote	her	life	to	campaigning	for	research, treatment	and	an	end	to	the	stigmatization	of	AIDS	and	HIV	sufferers.

Soon	afterwards,	she	found	a	prominent	platform	at	the	annual	Republican National	Convention.	She	had	close	links	with	the	party:	her	father	was	a leading	Republican	adviser	and	she	herself	had	worked	for	President	Gerald Ford.

Her	address	was	delivered	with	remarkable	dignity	and	composure,	and without	reference	to	notes.	In	this	accessible,	restrained	speech,	she	calls	for awareness,	compassion	and	action,	identifying	herself	-	a	white,	well-to-do, heterosexual	mother	-	with	the	socially	excluded	groups	often	associated with	the	disease.	She	also	warns	against	complacency,	referring	to	Pastor

Martin	Niemöller's	famous	dictum,	'I	was	not	a	Jew,	so	I	did	not	protest.'

Fisher's	straight-talking	appeal	won	warm	support	from	the	convention	and the	speech	quickly	became	famous	under	the	title	'A	Whisper	of	AIDS'.	It was	an	early	landmark	in	Fisher's	long	and	continuing	career	as	an	AIDS campaigner.

Thank	you.	Thank	you.	Less	than	three	months	ago,	at	platform	hearings	in Salt	Lake	City,	I	asked	the	Republican	Party 1 	to	lift	the	shroud	of	silence	which has	been	draped	over	the	issue	of	HIV	and	AIDS.	I	have	come	tonight	to	bring our	silence	to	an	end.	I	bear	a	message	of	challenge,	not	self-congratulation.	I want	your	attention,	not	your	applause.

I	would	never	have	asked	to	be	HIV	positive,	but	I	believe	that	in	all	things	there is	a	purpose;	and	I	stand	before	you	and	before	the	nation	gladly.	The	reality	of AIDS	is	brutally	clear.	Two	hundred	thousand	Americans	are	dead	or	dying.	A million	more	are	infected.	Worldwide,	40	million,	60	million,	or	100	million infections	will	be	counted	in	the	coming	few	years.	But	despite	science	and research,	White	House	meetings	and	congressional	hearings;	despite	good intentions	and	bold	initiatives,	campaign	slogans	and	hopeful	promises,	it	is	despite	it	all	-	the	epidemic	which	is	winning	tonight.

In	the	context	of	an	election	year,	I	ask	you,	here	in	this	great	hall,	or	listening	in the	quiet	of	your	home,	to	recognize	that	AIDS	virus	is	not	a	political	creature.	It does	not	care	whether	you	are	Democrat	or	Republican;	it	does	not	ask	whether you	are	black	or	white,	male	or	female,	gay	or	straight,	young	or	old.	Tonight	I represent	an	AIDS	community	whose	members	have	been	reluctantly	drafted from	every	segment	of	American	society…

This	is	not	a	distant	threat.	It	is	a	present	danger.

The	rate	of	infection	is	increasing	fastest	among	women	and	children.	Largely unknown	a	decade	ago,	AIDS	is	the	third	leading	killer	of	young	adult Americans	today.	But	it	won't	be	third	for	long,	because	unlike	other	diseases, this	one	travels.	Adolescents	don't	give	each	other	cancer	or	heart	disease because	they	believe	they	are	in	love,	but	HIV	is	different;	and	we	have	helped	it along.

We	have	killed	each	other	with	our	ignorance,	our

## prejudice	and	our	silence.

We	may	take	refuge	in	our	stereotypes,	but	we	cannot	hide	there	long,	because HIV	asks	only	one	thing	of	those	it	attacks.	'Are	you	human?'	And	this	is	the right	question.	'Are	you	human?'	Because	people	with	HIV	have	not	entered some	alien	state	of	being.	They	are	human.	They	have	not	earned	cruelty,	and they	do	not	deserve	meanness.	They	don't	benefit	from	being	isolated	or	treated as	outcasts…

My	call	to	you,	my	party,	is	to	take	a	public	stand,	no	less	compassionate	than that	of	the	President	and	Mrs	Bush. 2 	They	have	embraced	me	and	my	family	in memorable	ways.	In	the	place	of	judgement,	they	have	shown	affection.	In difficult	moments,	they	have	raised	our	spirits.	In	the	darkest	hours,	I	have	seen them	reaching	not	only	to	me,	but	also	to	my	parents,	armed	with	that	stunning grief	and	special	grace	that	comes	only	to	parents	who	have	themselves	leaned too	long	over	the	bedside	of	a	dying	child.

With	the	President's	leadership,	much	good	has	been	done.	Much	of	the	good has	gone	unheralded,	and	as	the	President	has	insisted,	much	remains	to	be	done. But	we	do	the	President's	cause	no	good	if	we	praise	the	American	family	but ignore	a	virus	that	destroys	it…

My	father	has	devoted	much	of	his	lifetime	guarding	against	another	holocaust. He	is	part	of	the	generation	who	heard	Pastor	Niemöller	come	out	of	the	Nazi death	camps	to	say,	'They	came	after	the	Jews,	and	I	was	not	a	Jew,	so	I	did	not protest.	They	came	after	the	trade	unionists,	and	I	was	not	a	trade	unionist,	so	I did	not	protest.	Then	they	came	after	the	Roman	Catholics,	and	I	was	not	a Roman	Catholic,	so	I	did	not	protest.	Then	they	came	after	me,	and	there	was	no one	left	to	protest.' 3

## [Applause.]

The	lesson	history	teaches	is	this:	if	you	believe	you	are	safe,	you	are	at	risk.	If you	do	not	see	this	killer	stalking	your	children,	look	again.	There	is	no	family or	community,	no	race	or	religion,	no	place	left	in	America	that	is	safe.	Until	we genuinely	embrace	this	message,	we	are	a	nation	at	risk…

One	of	those	families	is	mine.	If	it	is	true	that	HIV	inevitably	turns	to	AIDS, then	my	children	will	inevitably	turn	to	orphans.

My	family	has	been	a	rock	of	support.	My	84-year-old	father,	who	has	pursued the	healing	of	the	nations,	will	not	accept	the	premise	that	he	cannot	heal	his daughter.	My	mother	refuses	to	be	broken.	She	still	calls	at	midnight	to	tell wonderful	jokes	that	make	me	laugh.	Sisters	and	friends,	and	my	brother	Phillip, whose	birthday	is	today,	all	have	helped	carry	me	over	the	hardest	places.	I	am blessed,	richly	and	deeply	blessed,	to	have	such	a	family.

[Applause	and	cheers.]

But	not	all	of	you	have	been	so	blessed.

## You	are	HIV	positive,	but	dare	not	say	it.	You	have	lost loved	ones,	but	you	dared	not	whisper	the	word	AIDS. You	weep	silently;	you	grieve	alone.

I	have	a	message	for	you.	It	is	not	you	who	should	feel	shame;	it	is	we.

We	who	tolerate	ignorance	and	practise	prejudice;	we	who	have	taught	you	to fear.

We	must	lift	our	shroud	of	silence,	making	it	safe	for	you	to	reach	out	for compassion.	It	is	our	task	to	seek	safety	for	our	children,	not	in	quiet	denial,	but in	effective	action.

Someday	our	children	will	be	grown.	My	son	Max,	now	four,	will	take	the measure	of	his	mother.	My	son	Zachary,	now	two,	will	sort	through	his memories.	I	may	not	be	here	to	hear	their	judgements,	but	I	know	already	what	I hope	they	are.	I	want	my	children	to	know	that	their	mother	was	not	a	victim. She	was	a	messenger.	I	do	not	want	them	to	think,	as	I	once	did,	that	courage	is the	absence	of	fear.	I	want	them	to	know	that	courage	is	the	strength	to	act wisely	when	most	we	are	afraid.

I	want	them	to	have	the	courage	to	step	forward	when	called	by	their	nation	or their	party	and	give	leadership,	no	matter	what	the	personal	cost…To	my children,	I	make	this	pledge:	I	will	not	give	in,	Zachary,	because	I	draw	my courage	from	you.	Your	silly	giggle	gives	me	hope;	your	gentle	prayers	give	me strength;	and	you,	my	child,	give	me	the	reason	to	say	to	America,	'You	are	at risk.'	And	I	will	not	rest,	Max,	until	I	have	done	all	I	can	to	make	your	world safe.	I	will	seek	a	place	where	intimacy	is	not	the	prelude	to	suffering.	I	will	not hurry	to	leave	you,	my	children,	but	when	I	go,	I	pray	that	you	will	not	suffer shame	on	my	account.

To	all	within	the	sound	of	my	voice,	I	appeal.	Learn	with	me	the	lessons	of history	and	of	grace,	so	my	children	will	not	be	afraid	to	say	the	word	'AIDS' when	I	am	gone.	Then,	their	children	and	yours	may	not	need	to	whisper	it	at	all. God	bless	the	children,	and	God	bless	us	all.

Good	night.
