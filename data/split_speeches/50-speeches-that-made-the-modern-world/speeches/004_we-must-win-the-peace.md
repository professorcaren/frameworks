## 'We	must	win	the	peace'

25	June	1923,	Rome,	Italy

During	his	first	year	as	prime	minister,	Mussolini	was	still	strengthening	his grasp	on	power.	One	key	strand	of	his	appeal	was	patriotism,	and	at	a	rally	to mark	the	fifth	anniversary	of	the	Battle	of	the	Piave,	he	gave	this grandstanding	speech	in	celebration	of	Italian	martial	success.

Italy	had	entered	World	War	I	in	1915	on	the	side	of	the	UK	and	France, hoping	to	win	territory	from	Austria-Hungary	and	Germany.	A	critical conflict	occurred	in	June	1918,	when	Italian	troops	repulsed	an	attack	by	the Austro-Hungarian	army	across	the	river	Piave.	Four	months	later,	the	Italian army	scored	an	even	more	decisive	victory	at	the	Battle	of	Vittorio	Veneto. However,	Italy	received	little	in	the	peace	treaties	that	followed	the	war;	and it	was	partly	out	of	resentment	over	this	that	Mussolini	built	his	popularity.

Mussolini	was	a	charismatic	and	inspiring	public	speaker,	whose	oratorical techniques	-	like	his	political	policies	-	prefigured	those	of	Adolf	Hitler.

Addressing	a	huge	crowd	at	the	Palazzo	Venezia,	he	feigns	reluctance	to speak,	before	unleashing	a	typically	rousing	address.

Although	he	insists	the	Blackshirts'	march	on	Rome	'buried	the	past',	he alludes	strongly	to	the	city's	ancient	heritage	as	an	invincible	military	power. His	purpose	is	to	enlist	popular	support	and	discourage	dissent;	and	he excites	the	crowd	into	a	denunciation	of	those	who	would	'maim	victory', before	rewarding	them	with	a	vision	of	Italy	as	a	great	and	'imperishable' power.	The	translation	is	by	Baron	Bernardo	Quaranta	di	San	Severino.

Fellow	soldiers:	after	your	ranks,	so	well	disciplined	and	of	such	fine bearing,	have	marched	past	His	Majesty	the	King,	the	intangible	symbol	of	the country;	after	the	austere	ceremony	in	its	silent	solemnity	before	the	tomb	of	the Unknown	Warrior	-	after	this	formidable	display	of	sacred	strength,	words	from me	are	absolutely	superfluous,	and	I	do	not	intend	to	make	a	speech.	The	march of	today	is	a	manifestation	full	of	significance	and	warning.	A	whole	people	in arms	has	met	today	in	spirit	in	the	Eternal	City. 1 It	is	a	whole	people	who,	above unavoidable	party	differences,	finds	itself	strongly	united	when	the	safety	of	the common	motherland	is	at	stake.

On	the	occasion	of	the	Etna	eruption, 2 	national	solidarity	was	wonderfully manifested;	from	every	town,	every	village,	one	might	say	from	every	hamlet,	a fraternal	heart-throb	went	out	to	the	land	stricken	by	calamity.

Today	tens	of	thousands	of	soldiers,	thousands	of	standards	-	with	men	coming to	Rome	from	all	parts	of	Italy	and	from	the	far-away	colonies,	from	abroad	bear	witness	that	the	unity	of	the	Italian	nation	is	an	accomplished	and irrevocable	fact.

After	seven	months	of	government,	to	talk	to	you,	my	comrades	of	the	trenches, is	the	highest	honour	which	could	fall	to	my	lot.	And	I	do	not	say	this	in	order	to flatter	you,	nor	to	pay	you	a	tribute	which	might	seem	formal	on	an	occasion	like this.	I	have	the	right	to	interpret	the	thoughts	of	this	meeting,	which	gathers	to listen	to	my	words,	as	an	expression	of	solidarity	with	the	national	government.

## [Cries	of	assent.]

Let	us	not	utter	useless	and	fantastical	words.	Nobody	attacks	the	sacred	liberty of	the	Italian	people.	But	I	ask	you:	should	there	be	liberty	to	maim	victory?

## [Cries	of	'No!	no!']

Should	there	be	liberty	to	strike	at	the	nation?	Should	there	be	liberty	for	those who	have	as	their	programme	the	overthrow	of	our	national	institutions?

## [Cries	of	'No!	no!']

I	repeat	what	I	explicitly	said	before.	I	do	not	feel	myself	infallible,	I	feel	myself a	man	like	you.	I	do	not	repulse	-	I	cannot	-	I	shall	not	repulse	any	loyal	and sincere	collaboration.

Fellow	soldiers:	the	task	which	weighs	on	my	shoulders,	but	also	on	yours,	is simply	immense,	and	to	it	we	shall	be	pledged	for	many	years.

It	is,	therefore,	necessary	not	to	waste,	but	to	treasure	and	utilize	all	the	energies which	could	be	turned	to	the	good	of	our	country.

Five	years	have	passed	since	the	Battle	of	the	Piave,	from	that	victory…It	is necessary	to	proclaim,	for	you	who	listen	to	me,	and	also	for	those	who	read what	I	say,	that	the	victory	of	the	Piave	was	the	deciding	factor	of	the	war.	On the	Piave	the	Austro-Hungarian	Empire	went	to	pieces,	from	the	Piave	started the	flight	on	white	wings	of	the	victory	of	the	people	in	arms.

The	government	means	to	exalt	the	spiritual	strength	which	rises	out	of	the victory	of	a	people	in	arms.	It	does	not	mean	to	disperse	them,	because	it represents	the	sacred	seed	of	the	future.	The	more	distant	we	get	from	those days,	from	that	memorable	victory,	the	more	they	seem	to	us	wonderful,	the more	the	victory	appears	enveloped	in	a	halo	of	legend.	In	such	a	victory everybody	would	wish	to	have	taken	part!

We	must	win	the	peace!	Too	late	somebody	perceived	that

## …when	the	country	is	in	danger,	the	duty	of	all	citizens, from	the	highest	to	the	lowest,	is	only	one:	to	fight,	to suffer	and	-	if	needs	be	-	to	die!

We	have	won	the	war,	we	have	demolished	an	empire	which	threatened	our frontiers,	stifled	us	and	held	us	for	ever	under	the	extortion	of	armed	menace. History	has	no	end.

Comrades:	the	history	of	peoples	is	not	measured	by	years,	but	by	tens	of	years, by	centuries.	This	manifestation	of	yours	is	an	infallible	sign	of	the	vitality	of	the

Italian	people.	The	phrase	'we	must	win	the	peace'	is	not	an	empty	one.	It contains	a	profound	truth.	Peace	is	won	by	harmony,	by	work	and	by	discipline. This	is	the	new	gospel	which	has	been	opened	before	the	eyes	of	the	new generations	who	have	come	out	of	the	trenches;	a	gospel	simple	and straightforward,	which	takes	into	account	all	the	elements,	which	utilizes	all	the energies,	which	does	not	lend	itself	to	tyrannies	of	grotesque	exclusivism, because	it	has	one	sole	aim,	a	common	aim:	the	greatness	and	the	salvation	of the	nation!

Fellow	soldiers:	you	have	come	to	Rome,	and	it	is	natural	-	I	dare	to	say,	fated! Because	Rome	is	always,	as	it	will	be	tomorrow	and	in	the	centuries	to	come,	the living	heart	of	our	race!	It	is	the	imperishable	symbol	of	our	vitality	as	a	people. Who	holds	Rome,	holds	the	nation.

The	Blackshirts	buried	the	past.	I	assure	you,	my	fellow-soldiers,	that	my government,	in	spite	of	the	manifest	or	hidden	difficulties,	will	keep	its	pledges. It	is	the	government	of	Vittorio	Veneto. 3

You	feel	it	and	you	know	it,	and	if	you	did	not	believe	it,	you	would	not	be	here assembled	in	this	square.

Carry	back	to	your	towns,	to	your	lands,	to	your	houses,	distant	but	near	to	my heart,	the	vigorous	impression	of	this	meeting.	Keep	the	flame	burning,	because that	which	has	not	been	may	be,	because	if	victory	was	maimed	once,	it	does	not follow	that	it	can	be	maimed	a	second	time!

[Loud	cheers,	repeated	cries	of,	'We	swear	it!']

I	keep	in	mind	your	oath.	I	count	upon	you	as	I	count	upon	all	good	Italians,	but I	count,	above	all,	upon	you,	because	you	are	of	my	generation,	because	you have	come	out	from	the	bloody	filth	of	the	trenches,	because	you	have	lived	and struggled	and	suffered	in	the	face	of	death,	because	you	have	fulfilled	your	duty and	have	the	right	to	vindicate	that	to	which	you	are	entitled,	not	only	from	the material	but	from	the	moral	point	of	view.

I	tell	you,	I	swear	to	you,	that	the	time	is	past	for	ever	when	fighters	returning from	the	trenches	had	to	be	ashamed	of	themselves;	the	time	when,	owing	to	the threatening	attitudes	of	Communists,	the	officers	received	the	cowardly	advice to	dress	in	plain	clothes.

[Applause.]

All	that	is	buried.	You	must	not	forget,	and	nobody	forgets,	that	seven	months ago	52,000	armed	Blackshirts	came	to	Rome	to	bury	the	past!

[Loud	cheers.]

Soldiers,	fellow	soldiers:	let	us	raise	before	our	great unknown	comrade	the	cry	which	sums	up	our	faith. Long	live	the	King!	Long	live	Italy,	victorious, impregnable,	immortal!

[Loud	cheers,	with	flags	raised.]

## Franklin	D	Roosevelt

## American	statesman

Franklin	Delano	Roosevelt	(1882-1945)	came	to	power	as	US	President	during the	Great	Depression	of	1929-39,	which	he	met	by	launching	his	innovative New	Deal	programme.	On	the	strength	of	his	success	in	these	reforms,	Roosevelt was	re-elected	by	a	landslide	in	1936,	and	secured	a	third	term	in	1940	and	a fourth	in	1944.	During	the	late	1930s,	he	endeavoured	to	avoid	involvement	in the	coming	European	conflict,	but	on	the	outbreak	of	World	War	II	he	modified the	USA's	neutrality	in	favour	of	the	Allies.	Eventually,	the	USA	was	brought fully	into	the	conflict	by	Japan's	attack	on	Pearl	Harbor	(December	1941). Roosevelt	died	three	weeks	before	the	Nazi	surrender.
