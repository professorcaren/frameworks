## 'To	be	a	revolutionary	you	have	first	to	have	a revolution'

19	August	1960,	Havana,	Cuba

The	repressive	policies	and	economic	struggles	that	marked	Castro's	long regime	in	Cuba	have	diminished	his	folk-hero	status.	No	such	problem	for his	right-hand	man	Che	Guevara,	whose	good	looks	and	youthful	death	(aged 39)	created	an	enduring	romantic	image.

But	Che	-	whose	nickname	is	an	Argentinian	greeting	-	was	more	than simply	a	handsome	pin-up.	While	training	as	a	doctor,	he	developed	a	keen understanding	of	politics,	economics	and	Marxist	ideology;	he	later	became an	expert	guerrilla	strategist.	He	was	famously	described	by	the	French philosopher	and	writer	Jean-Paul	Sartre	as	'the	most	complete	human	being of	our	time'.

During	the	revolution	led	by	Castro,	Guevara	spent	two	years	living	in Cuba's	Sierra	Maestra	mountains,	and	helped	lead	the	peasant	army	to victory,	overthrowing	the	despotic	regime	of	General	Fulgencio	Batista.

After	Castro's	installation	as	prime	minister,	Cuba	underwent	rapid	socioeconomic	change,	forging	an	alliance	with	the	USSR	in	defiance	of American	sanctions.	Guevara	spearheaded	revolutionary	reforms,	often leading	by	example,	and	won	enormous	affection	from	the	Cuban	people.

This	speech,	translated	by	Beth	Kurti,	was	given	to	medical	professionals	at the	Confederation	of	Cuban	Workers.	In	it,	Guevara	harks	back	to	his professional	roots	but	relates	all	work	to	egalitarian	principles.

He	was	a	fiery	speaker,	who	invariably	wore	green	fatigues	and	black	beret	even	when	addressing	the	United	Nations	in	1964	-	and	constantly	smoked cigars	despite	severe	asthma.	Witnesses	describe	the	'charisma'	and	'moral sense'	of	his	speeches.	Though	his	relationship	with	Castro	ultimately soured,	he	is	still	considered	a	national	hero	in	Cuba.

Almost	everyone	knows	that	years	ago	I	began	my	career	as	a	doctor.	And when	I	began	as	a	doctor,	when	I	began	to	study	medicine,	the	majority	of	the concepts	I	have	today,	as	a	revolutionary,	were	absent	from	my	store	of	ideals…

After	graduation…I	began	to	travel	throughout	America, 1 	and	I	became acquainted	with	all	of	it…

I	came	into	close	contact	with	poverty,	hunger,	and	disease;	with	the	inability	to treat	a	child	because	of	lack	of	money;	with	the	stupefaction	provoked	by continual	hunger	and	punishment…And	I	began	to	realize	at	that	time	that	there were	things	that	were	almost	as	important	to	me	as	becoming	a	famous	scientist or	making	a	significant	contribution	to	medical	science:	I	wanted	to	help	those people….

…I	realized	a	fundamental	thing.	For	one	to	be	a	revolutionary	doctor	or	to	be	a revolutionary	at	all,	there	must	first	be	a	revolution.	Isolated	individual endeavour,	for	all	its	purity	of	ideals,	is	of	no	use,	and	the	desire	to	sacrifice	an entire	lifetime	to	the	noblest	of	ideals	serves	no	purpose	if	one	works	alone, solitarily,	in	some	corner	of	America,	fighting	against	adverse	governments	and social	conditions	which	prevent	progress.

To	create	a	revolution,	one	must	have	what	there	is	in Cuba	-	the	mobilization	of	a	whole	people…

who	learn	by	the	use	of	arms	and	the	exercise	of	militant	unity	to	understand	the value	of	arms	and	the	value	of	this	unity.

And	now	we	have	come	to	the	nucleus	of	the	problem	we	have	before	us	at	this time.	Today	one	finally	has	the	right	and	event	he	duty	to	be,	above	all	things,	a revolutionary	doctor,	that	is	to	say	a	man	who	utilizes	the	technical	knowledge of	his	profession	in	the	service	of	the	revolution	and	the	people.	But	now	old questions	reappear:	How	does	one	actually	carry	out	a	work	of	social	welfare? How	does	one	unite	individual	endeavour	with	the	needs	of	society?

…In	Cuba	a	new	type	of	man	is	being	created, 2 	whom	we	cannot	fully	appreciate here	in	the	capital,	but	who	is	found	in	every	corner	of	the	country.	Those	of	you who	went	to	the	Sierra	Maestra	on	26	July 3 	must	have	seen	two	completely unknown	things.	Firstly,	an	army	with	hoes	and	pickaxes,	an	army	whose greatest	pride	is	to	parade	in	the	patriotic	festivals	of	Oriente 	with	hoes	and	axes 4 raised,	while	their	military	comrades	march	with	rifles.

But	you	must	have	seen	something	even	more	important.	You	must	have	seen children	whose	physical	constitutions	appeared	to	be	those	of	eight-or	nine-yearolds,	yet	almost	all	of	whom	are	13	or	14…

In	this	tiny	Cuba,	with	its	four	or	five	television	channels	and	hundreds	of	radio stations,	with	all	the	advances	of	modern	science,	when	those	children	arrived	at school	for	the	first	time	at	night	and	saw	the	electric	light	bulbs,	they	exclaimed that	the	stars	were	very	low	that	night.	And	those	children,	some	of	whom	you must	have	seen,	are	learning	in	collective	schools	skills	ranging	from	reading	to trades,	and	even	the	very	difficult	science	of	becoming	revolutionaries.

Those	are	the	new	humans	being	born	in	Cuba.	They	are	being	born	in	isolated areas,	in	different	parts	of	the	Sierra	Maestra,	and	also	in	the	cooperatives	and work	centres.

All	this	has	to	do	with	the	theme	of	our	talk	today,	the	integration	of	the physician	or	any	other	medical	worker,	into	the	revolutionary	movement…The principle	upon	which	the	fight	against	disease	should	be	based	is	the	creation	of a	robust	body;	but	not	the	creation	of	a	robust	body	by	the	artistic	work	of	a doctor	upon	a	weak	organism;	rather,	the	creation	of	a	robust	body	with	the	work of	the	whole	collectivity,	upon	the	entire	social	collectivity.

Some	day,	therefore,	medicine	will	have	to	convert	itself	into	a	science	that serves	to	prevent	disease	and	orients	the	public	toward	carrying	out	its	medical duties.	Medicine	should	only	intervene	in	cases	of	extreme	urgency,	to	perform surgery	or	something	else	which	lies	outside	the	skills	of	the	people	of	the	new society	we	are	creating…

But	for	this	task	of	organization,	as	for	all	the	revolutionary	tasks,	fundamentally it	is	the	individual	who	is	needed…

We	are	at	the	end	of	an	era,	and	not	only	herein	Cuba.	No	matter	what	is	hoped or	said	to	the	contrary,	the	form	of	capitalism	we	have	known,	in	which	we	were raised,	and	under	which	we	have	suffered,	is	being	defeated	all	over	the	world… Such	a	profound	social	change	demands	equally	profound	changes	in	the	mental structure	of	the	people…

One	way	of	getting	to	the	heart	of	the	medical	question	is	not	only	to	visit	and become	acquainted	with	the	people	who	make	up	the	cooperatives	and	work centres,	but	to	find	out	what	diseases	they	have,	what	their	sufferings	are,	what have	been	their	chronic	miseries	for	years,	and	what	has	been	the	inheritance	of centuries	of	repression	and	total	submission.	The	doctor,	the	medical	worker, must	go	to	the	core	of	his	new	work,	which	is	the	man	within	the	mass,	the	man within	the	collectivity.

Always,	no	matter	what	happens	in	the	world,	the	doctor	is	extremely	close	to his	patient	and	knows	the	innermost	depths	of	his	psyche.	Because	he	is	the	one who	attacks	pain	and	mitigates	it,	he	performs	an	invaluable	labour	of	much responsibility	in	society.

A	few	months	ago,	here	in	Havana,	it	happened	that	a	group	of	newly	graduated doctors	did	not	want	to	go	into	the	country's	rural	areas,	and	demanded remuneration	before	they	would	agree	to	go.	From	the	point	of	view	of	the	past	it is	the	most	logical	thing	in	the	world	for	this	to	occur;	at	least,	so	it	seems	to	me, for	I	can	understand	it	perfectly.	The	situation	brings	back	to	me	the	memory	of what	I	was	and	what	I	thought	a	few	years	ago…the	gladiator	who	rebels,	the solitary	fighter	who	wants	to	assure	a	better	future,	better	conditions,	and	to make	valid	the	need	people	have	of	him.

But	what	would	have	happened	if	-	instead	of	these	boys,	whose	families generally	were	able	to	pay	for	their	years	of	study	-	others	of	less	fortunate means	had	just	finished	their	schooling	and	were	beginning	the	exercise	of	their profession?…

What	would	have	happened,	simply,	is	that	the	peasants	would	have	run, immediately	and	with	unreserved	enthusiasm,	to	help	their	brothers.

They	would	have	requested	the	most	difficult	and	responsible	jobs	in	order	to demonstrate	that	the	years	of	study	they	had	received	had	not	been	given	in	vain. What	would	have	happened	is	what	will	happen	in	six	or	seven	years,	when	the new	students,	children	of	workers	and	peasant,	receive	professional	degrees	of all	kinds…

None	of	us	-	none	of	the	first	group	which	arrived	in	the Granma , 5 who	settled in	the	Sierra	Maestra	and	learned	to	respect	the	peasant	and	the	worker	living with	him	-	had	a	peasant	or	working-class	background.	Naturally,	there	were those	who	had	had	to	work,	who	had	known	certain	privations	in	childhood;	but hunger,	what	is	called	real	hunger,	was	something	none	of	us	had	experienced. But	we	began	to	know	it	in	the	two	long	years	in	the	Sierra	Maestra.	And	then many	things	became	very	clear…

## We	understood	perfectly	that	the	life	of	a	single	human being	is	worth	a	million	times	more	than	all	the	property of	the	richest	man	on	earth.

And	we	learned	it;	we,	who	were	not	of	the	working	class	nor	of	the	peasant class.	And	are	we	now	going	to	tell	the	four	winds,	we	who	were	the	privileged ones,	that	the	rest	of	the	people	in	Cuba	cannot	learn	it	also?

Yes,	they	can	learn	it:	the	Revolution	today	demands	that	they	learn	it,	demands that	it	be	well	understood	that	far	more	important	than	a	good	remuneration	is the	pride	of	serving	one's	neighbour;	that	much	more	definitive	and	much	more lasting	than	all	the	gold	that	one	can	accumulate	is	the	gratitude	of	a	people.	And each	doctor,	within	the	circle	of	his	activities,	can	and	must	accumulate	that valuable	treasure,	the	gratitude	of	the	people…

We	shall	see	that	diseases	need	not	always	be	treated	as	they	are	in	big-city hospitals.	We	shall	see	that	the	doctor	has	to	be	a	farmer	also	and	plant	new foods	and	sow,	by	example,	the	desire	to	consume	new	foods,	to	diversify	the Cuban	nutritional	structure,	which	is	so	limited,	so	poor,	in	one	of	the	richest countries	in	the	world,	agriculturally	and	potentially.	The	first	thing	we	will	have to	do	is	not	to	go	to	the	people	to	offer	them	our	wisdom.

We	must	go,	rather,	to	demonstrate	that	we	are	going	to	learn	with	the	people, that	together	we	are	going	to	carry	out	that	great	and	beautiful	common experiment:	the	construction	of	a	new	Cuba…

I	was	telling	you	that	to	be	a	revolutionary	you	have	first	to	have	a	revolution. We	already	have	it.	Next,	you	have	to	know	the	people	with	whom	you	are going	to	work…

…The	new	armies	which	are	being	formed	to	defend	the	country	must	be	armies with	different	tactics.	The	doctor	will	have	an	enormous	importance	within	the plan	of	the	new	army.	He	must	continue	being	a	doctor,	which	is	one	of	the	most beautiful	tasks	there	is	and	one	of	the	most	important	in	war…In	time	of	danger they	should	go	immediately	to	solve	the	problems	of	the	poor	people	of	Cuba. But	the	militias	offer	also	an	opportunity	to	live	together,	joined	and	made	equal by	a	uniform,	with	men	of	all	the	social	classes	of	Cuba.

If	we	medical	workers	-	and	permit	me	to	use	once	again	a	title	which	I	had forgotten	some	time	ago	-	are	successful,	if	we	use	this	new	weapon	of solidarity,	if	we	know	the	goals,	know	the	enemy,	and	know	the	direction	we have	to	take,	then	all	that	is	left	for	us	to	know	is	the	part	of	the	way	to	be covered	each	day.	And	that	part	no	one	can	show	us;	that	part	is	the	private journey	of	each	individual.	Now	that	we	have	all	the	elements	for	our	march toward	the	future,	let	us	remember	the	advice	of	Martí: 6 	'The	best	way	of	telling is	doing.'

Let	us	march,	then,	toward	Cuba's	future.

## John	F	Kennedy

## American	statesman

John	Fitzgerald	Kennedy	(1917-63)	was	elected	to	the	US	House	of Representatives	as	a	Democrat	from	Massachusetts	in	1946,	won	a	Senate	seat	in 1952	and	the	next	year	married	Jacqueline	Lee	Bouvier	(1929-94).	He	won	the presidential	nomination	in	1960	and	became	the	first	Catholic	and,	at	43,	the youngest	person	to	be	elected	president.	He	introduced	a	legislative	programme, the	'New	Frontier',	which	aimed	to	extend	civil	rights	and	to	provide	funding	for education,	medical	care	for	the	elderly	and	the	space	programme,	though	much of	it	stalled	in	Congress.	He	faced	a	series	of	foreign	policy	crises,	including	the unsuccessful	invasion	of	Fidel	Castro's	Cuba	at	the	Bay	of	Pigs	(April	1961),	the building	of	the	Berlin	Wall	(August	1961)	and	the	Cuban	Missile	Crisis	(October 1962).	On	22	November	1963,	he	was	assassinated	by	rifle	fire	while	being driven	in	an	open	car	through	Dallas,	Texas.	Although	the	legislative achievements	of	his	brief	administration	were	modest,	his	martyrdom	enabled his	successor	and	vice	president,	Lyndon	B	Johnson,	to	promote	the	social reforms	of	the	'Great	Society'	as	his	legacy.
