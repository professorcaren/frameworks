## 'Without	recognition	of	human	rights	we	shall	never have	peace'

10	April	1957,	New	York	City,	USA

Dag	Hammarskjöld's	outstanding	talent	for	diplomacy	was	put	to	the	test during	the	final	years	of	his	life:	indeed,	if	the	conspiracy	theories	are	true,	it contributed	to	his	early	death.	As	Secretary-General	of	the	United	Nations, he	had	relatively	little	power,	but	as	a	negotiator	he	was	calm,	tactful	and effective.	Shortly	before	giving	this	speech,	he	had	helped	defuse	the	Suez Crisis	in	which	British,	French,	Israeli	and	Egyptian	forces	went	to	war	over control	of	the	Suez	Canal,	and	the	USSR	threatened	to	intervene.	He	had	also created	an	emergency	international	force	to	maintain	peace.

This	address	was	given	at	the	50th	anniversary	celebrations	of	the	American Jewish	Committee.	This	had	been	a	devastating	half-century	for	Jews,	yet had	also	seen	the	establishment	of	a	Jewish	homeland	in	Israel.	However, Hammarskjöld	refers	only	briefly	to	Jewish	history,	instead	using	his	speech to	explore	some	of	the	principles	that	informed	his	struggle	for	peace.	Above all,	he	stresses	the	dependence	of	peace	on	a	recognition	of	human	rights, and	the	centrality	of	tolerance	to	the	goals	of	his	organization.

Four	years	ago	today,	I	was	inducted	into	my	present	office,	to	which	I	had been	catapulted	without	previous	soundings,	indeed,	without	any	pre-warning.	I felt	that	it	was	my	duty	to	accept	it,	not	because	of	any	feeling	of	confidence	in my	personal	capacity	to	overcome	the	difficulties	which	might	arise,	but because,	under	the	conditions	then	prevailing,	the	one	to	whom	the	call	had come	seemed	to	me	in	duty	bound	to	respond.

The	situation	that	faced	me	at	the	very	outset	has	proved	not	to	be	unique.	It	has been	repeated	several	times	in	the	past	few	years,	most	recently	in	relation	to problems	of	the	Middle	East.	The	other	day,	returning	from	the	latest	visit	to	that area	on	a	UN	mission,	I	read	a	book	by	Arthur	Waley 1 	-	certainly	well	known	to many	of	you	as	one	of	the	great	interpreters	of	Chinese	thought	and	literature, and	as	one	of	those	great	Jewish	students	of	humane	letters	who	have	so splendidly	enriched	our	cultural	tradition.	In	his	work,	Waley	quotes	what	an early	Chinese	historian	had	to	say	about	the	philosopher	Sung	Tzu 2 	and	his followers,	some	350	years	BC.	To	one	who	works	in	the	United	Nations,	the quotation	strikes	a	familiar	note.	It	runs	as	follows:

Constantly	rebuffed	but	never	discouraged,	they	went	round	from	state	to	state, helping	people	to	settle	their	differences,	arguing	against	wanton	attack	and pleading	for	the	suppression	of	arms,	that	the	age	in	which	they	lived	might	be saved	from	its	state	of	continual	war.	To	this	end	they	interviewed	princes	and lectured	the	common	people,	nowhere	meeting	with	any	great	success,	but obstinately	persisting	in	their	task,	till	kings	and	commoners	alike	grew	weary	of listening	to	them.	Yet	undeterred	they	continued	to	force	themselves	on	people's attention.

Is	this	a	description	of	a	quixotic	group,	whose	efforts	are	doomed	to	failure? The	wording,	with	its	tone	of	frustration,	may	lead	us	to	think	so.	However,	I believe	that	this	interpretation	would	be	wrong.	The	historian	tells	us	about	a group	engaged	in	a	struggle	he	considers	very	much	worthwhile	and	one	which will	have	to	go	on	until	success	is	achieved…

We	can	learn	from	his	attitude,	both	in	our	efforts	to	move	towards	peace	and	in our	work	for	universal	recognition	of	human	rights.

We	know	that	the	question	of	peace	and	the	question	of human	rights	are	closely	related.	Without	recognition	of

## human	rights	we	shall	never	have	peace,	and	it	is	only within	the	framework	of	peace	that	human	rights	can	be fully	developed.

In	fact,	the	work	for	peace	is	basically	a	work	for	the	most	elementary	of	human rights:	the	right	of	everyone	to	security	and	to	freedom	from	fear.

We,	therefore,	recognize	it	as	one	of	the	first	duties	of	a	government	to	take measures	in	order	to	safeguard	for	its	citizens	this	very	right.	But	we	also recognize	it	as	an	obligation	for	the	emerging	world	community	to	assist governments	in	safeguarding	this	elementary	human	right	without	having	to	lock themselves	in	behind	the	wall	of	arms.

The	dilemma	of	our	age,	with	its	infinite	possibilities	of	self-destruction,	is	how to	grow	out	of	the	world	of	armaments	into	a	world	of	international	security, based	on	law…

The	effort	may	seem	hopeless.	It	will	prove	hopeless	unless	we,	all	of	us,	show the	persistence	of	Sung	Tzu	and	his	followers,	and	unless	peoples	and governments	alike	are	willing	to	take	smaller	immediate	risks	in	order	to	have	a better	chance	to	avoid	the	final	disaster	threatening	us	if	we	do	not	manage	to turn	the	course	of	developments	in	a	new	direction.

The	United	Nations	finds	itself	in	a	difficult	stage	of	its	development.	It	is	still too	weak	to	provide	the	security	desired	by	all,	while	being	strong	enough	and alive	enough	effectively	to	point	out	the	direction	in	which	the	solution	must	be sought.	In	its	present	phase,	the	organization	may	look	to	many	like	a	preacher who	cannot	impose	the	law	he	states	or	realize	the	gospel	he	interprets.	It	is understandable	if	those	who	have	this	impression	turn	away	in	distrust	or	with cynical	criticism,	forgetting	that	setbacks	in	efforts	to	implement	an	ideal	do	not prove	that	the	ideal	is	wrong,	and	overlooking	also	that	at	the	beginning	of	great changes	in	human	society	there	must	always	be	a	stage	of	such	frailty	or	seeming inconsistency.

It	is	easy	to	say	that	it	is	pointless	to	state	the	law	if	it	cannot	be	enforced. However,	to	do	so	is	to	forget	that	if	the	law	is	the	inescapable	law	of	the	future; it	would	be	treason	to	the	future	not	to	state	the	law	simply	because	of	the difficulties	of	the	present.

Indeed,	how	could	it	ever	become	a	living	reality	if	those	who	are	responsible for	its	development	were	to	succumb	to	the	immediate	difficulties	arising	when it	is	still	a	revolutionary	element	in	the	life	of	society?

The	history	of	the	Jewish	people	offers	some	of	the	most	magnificent	examples of	how	ideals	and	law	may	be	brought	to	victory	through	courageous	assertion	of new	universal	principles,	which	the	wise	call	folly	when	they	are	first	introduced in	a	society	shaped	on	a	different	pattern.

The	thoughts	I	have	tried	to	express	apply	to	practically	the	whole	field	of United	Nations	activities,	but	in	particular	to	the	work	of	the	organization	for	the implementation	of	the	principles	of	the	Charter	in	the	fields	of	international security	and	disarmament	and	in	the	field	of	fundamental	human	rights.	They apply	likewise	to	the	United	Nations	itself	as	an	experiment	in	international organization.

But	is	not	an	experiment	something	tentative	and	passing?

And	should	not	the	United	Nations	be	regarded	as	something	definite	and lasting?

I	think	it	is	important	to	be	clear	on	this	point.	Certainly	the	experiences	and achievements	of	the	United	Nations	as	it	is	today	are	helping	us	to	build	the future….

## The	United	Nations	is,	and	should	be,	a	living,	evolving, experimental	institution.

If	it	should	ever	cease	to	be	so	it	should	be	revolutionized	or	swept	aside	for	a new	approach.

The	growth	of	social	institutions	is	always	one	where,	step	by	step,	the	form which	adequately	meets	the	need	is	shaped	through	selection,	or	out	of experience.	Thus	an	effort	that	has	not	yielded	all	the	results	hoped	for	has	not failed	if	it	has	provided	positive	experience	on	which	a	new	approach	can	be based.	An	attempt	which	has	proved	the	possibility	of	progress	has	served	the cause	of	progress	even	if	it	has	had	to	be	renewed	again	and	again,	and	in	new forms	or	settings	in	order	to	yield	full	success.	When	we	look	back	over	the experiences	in	the	United	Nations	over	the	past	few	months,	we	may	differ amongst	ourselves	as	to	the	wisdom	of	this	or	that	particular	stand	and	we	may have	doubts	about	the	end	result	of	this	or	that	step.	But	I	think	we	all	can	agree on	the	value	and	historical	importance	of	certain	developments.

First	of	all,	it	proved	possible	in	an	emergency	to	create	for	the	first	time	a	truly international	force.	This	force,	although	modest	in	size	and,	for	constitutional reasons,	also	modest	in	aim,	broke	new	ground	which	inevitably	will	count	in future	efforts	to	preserve	peace	and	promote	justice…

…Deeply	regrettable	though	the	conflicts	of	views	and	interests	were,	it	should not	be	forgotten	that	those	who	now	feel	they	had	to	sacrifice	for	the maintenance	of	a	principle,	in	a	different	situation	may	be	the	first	to	profit	from the	fact	that	the	principle	was	maintained.	As	individuals	we	know	that	the	law which	restrains	us	likewise	protects	us.	The	same	holds	true	in	international	life.

Some	moments	ago	I	referred	to	the	fact	that	lasting	peace	is	not	possible without	recognition	of	fundamental	human	rights	and	that	human	rights	cannot reach	their	full	development	unless	there	is	peace.	The	United	Nations	cannot lay	down	the	law	for	the	life	within	any	national	community.	Those	laws	have	to be	established	in	accordance	with	the	will	of	the	people,	as	expressed	in	the forms	indicated	by	their	chosen	constitution.

But	just	as	the	United	Nations	can	promote	peace,	so	it	can,	in	joint deliberations,	define	the	goals	of	human	rights	which	should	be	the	laws	of	the future	in	each	nation.	Whatever	the	distance	between	these	goals	and	the everyday	reality	we	meet	all	around	the	world,	it	is	not	vain	thus	to	set	the targets	as	they	present	themselves	to	the	most	mature	political	thinking	of	our age.

You	have	put	'the	pursuit	of	equality	at	home	and	abroad'	as	a	motto	of	your anniversary.	Interpreted	in	a	broad	sense	these	words	reflect	a	basic	human	right, equal	in	significance	to	the	right	to	security	and	freedom	from	fear.

The	underlying	problems	now	making	the	Middle	East	such	a	troubled	area	lend special	weight	to	the	undertaking	of	the	member	nations	in	the	Charter	'to practise	tolerance'.

The	words	just	quoted	from	the	Charter	are	among	those	which	link	its	text	to	a great	ethical	tradition.	They	are	often	overlooked,	sometimes	brushed	aside	as empty	ornaments	without	political	significance,	sometimes	honoured	by	lipservice.	However,	they	represent	an	element	without	which	the	Charter	and	the system	it	creates	would	disintegrate.	Both	the	work	for	peace	and	the	work	for human	rights	must	be	anchored	in	and	inspired	by	a	general	approach	which gives	balance	and	substance	to	the	results.	Peace	cannot	be	enforced	for	selfish reasons;	equality	cannot	be	imposed	as	an	abstract	concept.	In	fact,	attempts	to do	so	account	for	some	of	the	darkest	episodes	in	history.

## The	work	for	peace	must	be	animated	by	tolerance	and the	work	for	human	rights	by	respect	for	the	individual.

A	student	of	the	growth	of	human	rights	through	the	ages	will	recognize	its	close relationship	to	the	development	of	tolerance	inspired	by	intellectual	liberalism or,	perhaps	more	often,	by	ethical	concepts	of	religious	origin.

Attempts	are	made	to	link	the	development	of	human	rights	exclusively	to	the liberal	ideas	which	broke	through	to	predominance	in	the	Age	of	Enlightenment. However,	to	do	so	means	tome	to	overlook	the	historical	background	of	those ideas.	It	means	also	cutting	our	ties	to	a	source	of	strength	that	we	need	in	order to	carry	the	work	for	human	rights	to	fruition	and	to	give	to	those	rights,	when established,	their	fitting	spiritual	content.

To	some,	the	word	'tolerance'	may	sound	strange	in	a	time	of	'Cold	War'	and	of negotiations	'from	positions	from	strength';	it	may	have	an	overtone	of meekness	or	appeasement.	And	yet,	have	we	reason	to	believe	that	what	was	true in	the	past	is	no	longer	true?	It	is	not	the	weak	but	the	strong	who	practice tolerance,	and	the	strong	do	not	weaken	their	position	in	showing	tolerance.	On the	contrary,	only	through	tolerance	can	they	justify	their	strength.

## Harold	Macmillan

British	statesman

Maurice	Harold	Macmillan	later	1st	Earl	of	Stockton	(1894-1986)	stood successfully	as	Conservative	MP	for	Stockton-on-Tees	in	1924.	Not	always willing	to	conform	to	the	party	line,	he	remained	a	backbencher	until	1940,	after which	he	took	on	a	succession	of	government	posts.	Defeated	in	the	Labour landslide	of	1945,	he	was	returned	later	the	same	year	for	Bromley	and	held	this seat	until	he	retired	in	1964.	He	was	Minister	of	Housing	(1951-4),	Minister	of Defence	(1954-5),	then	Foreign	Minister	until	the	end	of	1955,	when	he	was appointed	Chancellor	of	the	Exchequer.	On	the	resignation	of	Anthony	Eden	in 1957	he	emerged,	in	R	A	Butler's	words,	as	'the	best	prime	minister	we	have'. As	an	intellectual	and	an	aristocrat,	he	was	regarded	with	suspicion	by	many. Nevertheless,	his	economic	expansionism	at	home,	his	resolution	in	foreign affairs,	his	integrity	and	his	infectious	optimism	inspired	confidence,	and	his popularity	soared.	In	1962,	after	some	electoral	setbacks,	he	carried	out	a	drastic 'purge'	of	his	government,	involving	seven	Cabinet	ministers.	Further	setbacks followed,	including	the	Profumo	scandal	(1963),	and	ill	health	brought	about	his reluctant	resignation	in1963.
