## 'Paris	outraged!	Paris	broken!	Paris	martyred!	But Paris	liberated!'

25	August	1944,	Paris,	France

When	de	Gaulle	made	his	triumphal	return	to	Paris,	France	had	been	under German	control	for	more	than	four	years.

Following	his	escape	to	London	in	1940,	he	had	been	sentenced	to	death	for treason	by	the	Vichy	government,	which	was	little	more	than	a	puppet regime	of	the	Nazis;	but	he	soon	established	himself	as	leader	of	the	Free French	Forces.	In	1943,	he	moved	his	headquarters	to	the	liberated	French territory	of	Algeria.

In	summer	1944,	Allied	forces	landed	in	France	(from	the	north	in	June; from	the	south	in	August),	pushing	back	the	German	occupiers.	As	US troops	closed	in	on	Paris,	the	citizens	went	on	strike	and	launched	skirmishes against	the	occupying	Germans.	US	forces	under	General	Dwight	D

Eisenhower	hesitated,	aware	that	Adolf	Hitler	had	ordered	his	troops	to destroy	the	city	rather	than	surrender	it.	Fearful	of	a	massacre	-	and	eager	to pre-empt	American	military	control	of	Paris	-	de	Gaulle	ordered	the	Free French	Forces	into	Paris,	and	it	was	to	them	that	the	Germans	surrendered	on 24	August.	This	was	a	triumph	for	de	Gaulle	-	who	had	flown	in	from Algiers	that	day	-	not	least	because	US	president	Franklin	D	Roosevelt mistrusted	him	and	had	initially	recognized	the	Vichy	government.

The	following	day,	de	Gaulle	addressed	the	expectant	crowds	from	the	Hôtel de	Ville,	announcing	the	liberation	of	the	city	and	the	restoration	of	French pride.	In	his	speech,	he	plays	successfully	to	the	crowd's	patriotism, personifying	Paris	as	a	heroic	survivor,	'bleeding	but	resolute'.

On	28	August,	he	brought	the	provisional	government	home	to	Paris.

Why	try	to	resist	the	emotion	which	now	seizes	all	of	us,	men	and	women alike,	who	are	here	at	home,	in	a	Paris	standing	tall,	liberating	herself,	and	able to	do	so	with	her	own	hands?

No!	We	shall	not	hide	this	profound	and	sacred	emotion.	These	are overwhelming	events	in	every	one	of	our	poor	lives.

Paris!	Paris	outraged!	Paris	broken!	Paris	martyred!	But	Paris	liberated! Liberated	by	herself,	liberated	by	her	people,	supported	by	the	armies	of	France, with	the	support	and	empowerment	of	all	France,

## …the	France	who	fights	back,	the	only	France,	the	true France,	the	eternal	France.

Well	now!	Since	the	enemy	who	held	Paris	has	surrendered	into	our	hands, France	herself	may	return	home	to	Paris.

She	returns	here,	bleeding	but	resolute.	She	returns	here	enlightened	by	a	great lesson,	but	more	certain	than	ever	of	her	obligations	and	her	rights.

I	shall	speak	first	of	her	obligations,	and	I	summarize	them	in	full	when	I	say that,	for	the	moment,	we	must	concern	ourselves	with	obligations	of	war.	The enemy	is	flagging	but	he	is	not	yet	beaten.	He	remains	on	our	soil.	We	must	not consider	ourselves	satisfied	simply	because,	with	the	support	of	our	beloved	and esteemed	allies,	we	have	driven	him	from	our	home.	We	must	invade	his territory,	for	that	is	the	victor's	duty.

That	is	why	the	French	advance	party	entered	Paris	with	cannon	fire.	That	is why	the	great	French	army	of	Italy	has	disembarked	in	the	Midi, 1 	and	is	making its	way	swiftly	up	the	Rhône	valley.	That	is	why	our	brave,	beloved	forces	of	the interior	will	equip	themselves	with	modern	weapons.	We	must	have	revenge, retaliation,	justice:	that	is	why	we	shall	continue	to	fight	until	the	final	day,	until the	day	of	complete	and	total	victory.

All	men	here,	and	all	who	hear	us	throughout	France,	know	that	this	duty	of	war demands	national	unity.	Those	others	of	us	-	we	who	shall	have	witnessed	the greatest	hours	of	our	history	-	need	desire	nothing	but	to	prove	ourselves	worthy of	France	right	until	the	end.

Long	live	France!

Ho	Chi	Minh	(1890-1969)	founded	the	Viet	Minh	Independence	League	in 1941,	directing	successful	military	operations	against	the	Japanese	occupiers	and later	against	the	French.	After	declaring	Vietnam's	independence	in	1945,	he	led the	successful	military	operation	against	the	French	in	the	Indochina	War	(194654).	After	the	partition	of	the	country	in	1954,	he	became	prime	minister	(19545)	and	president	(1954-69)	of	communist	North	Vietnam.	Re-elected	in	1960,	he enlisted	Chinese	support	in	the	war	between	North	and	South	Vietnam	and became	a	leading	force	in	the	conflict	in	the	1960s	as	it	widened	to	draw	in	other countries,	primarily	the	USA.	Despite	massive	US	military	intervention	in support	of	South	Vietnam	(1965-73),	Ho	Chi	Minh's	Viet	Cong	liberation	front retained	the	initiative	and	forced	a	ceasefire	in	1973,	four	years	after	the president's	death.
