## 'Our	acts	are	reaction	to	your	own	acts'

15	April	2004,	sound	recording	made	in	an	undeclared	location

After	the	attacks	of	2001,	Osama	bin	Laden	taunted	his	enemies	with	taped audio	and	video	messages,	delivered	to	broadcasting	organizations.	In	April 2004,	one	such	audio	tape,	believed	to	be	a	recording	of	his	voice,	was broadcast	by	the	pan-Arab	satellite	channels	al-Arabiya	and	al-Jazeera.

On	the	tape,	bin	Laden	outlines	his	view	of	the	global	security	situation.	He argues	that	his	followers	are	targeting	the	West	because	Western	nations have	harmed	Muslim	interests,	denying	them	power	and	security.	This,	he suggests,	is	morally	equivalent	to	the	acts	of	terrorism	pursued	by	al-Qaeda	'your	commodity	that	was	returned	to	you'.

He	points	specifically	to	the	plight	of	the	Palestinians	displaced	and dispossessed	by	Israel,	with	the	support	of	the	USA.	Westerners	who	desire peace,	he	says,	should	promote	the	cause	of	Palestinians	and	other	oppressed Muslim	people.	He	emphasizes	this	message	with	a	blunt	threat:	'stop shedding	our	blood	so	as	to	preserve	your	blood'.

This	'peace	offer'	was	interpreted	by	most	Western	commentators	as propaganda	designed	to	appeal	to	Western	intellectuals,	who	might	influence their	governments	to	reduce	support	for	Israel	and	withdraw	troops	from Iraq.

Praise	be	to	Almighty	God;	peace	and	prayers	be	upon	our	Prophet Muhammad,	his	family,	and	companions.	This	is	a	message	to	our	neighbours north	of	the	Mediterranean,	containing	a	reconciliation	initiative	as	a	response	to their	positive	reactions.

Praise	be	to	God;	praise	be	to	God;	praise	be	to	God	who	created	Heaven	and earth	with	justice	and	who	allowed	the	oppressed	to	punish	the	oppressor	in	the same	way.

Peace	upon	those	who	followed	the	right	path.	In	my	hands	there	is	a	message	to remind	you	that	justice	is	a	duty	towards	those	whom	you	love	and	those	whom you	do	not.	And	people's	rights	will	not	be	harmed	if	the	opponent	speaks	out about	them.

The	greatest	rule	of	safety	is	justice,	and	stopping	injustice	and	aggression.	It was	said:	oppression	kills	the	oppressors	and	the	hotbed	of	injustice	is	evil.	The situation	in	occupied	Palestine	is	an	example.	What	happened	on	11	September and	11	March 1 	is	your	commodity	that	was	returned	to	you.

It	is	known	that	security	is	a	pressing	necessity	for	all	mankind.	We	do	not	agree that	you	should	monopolize	it	only	for	yourselves.	Also,	vigilant	people	do	not allow	their	politicians	to	tamper	with	their	security.

Having	said	this,	we	would	like	to	inform	you	that	labeling	us	and	our	acts	as terrorism	is	also	a	description	of	you	and	of	your	acts.	Reaction	comes	at	the same	level	as	the	original	action.	Our	acts	are	reaction	to	your	own	acts,	which are	represented	by	the	destruction	and	killing	of	our	kinfolk	in	Afghanistan,	Iraq and	Palestine.	The	act	that	horrified	the	world	-	that	is,	the	killing	of	the	old, handicapped	Sheikh	Ahmed	Yassin, 2 	may	God	have	mercy	on	him	-	is	sufficient evidence.

We	pledge	to	God	that	we	will	punish	America	for	him,	God	willing.

Which	religion	considers	your	killed	ones	innocent	and	our	killed	ones worthless?	And	which	principle	considers	your	blood	real	blood	and	our	blood water?	Reciprocal	treatment	is	fair	and	the	one	who	starts	injustice	bears	greater blame.

As	for	your	politicians	and	those	who	have	followed	their	path,	who	insist	on ignoring	the	real	problem	of	occupying	the	entirety	of	Palestine	and	exaggerate lies	and	falsification	regarding	our	right	in	defence	and	resistance:	they	do	not respect	themselves.	They	also	disdain	the	blood	and	minds	of	peoples.	This	is because	their	falsification	increases	the	shedding	of	your	blood	instead	of sparing	it.

Moreover,	the	examining	of	the	developments	that	have	been	taking	place	-	in terms	of	killings	in	our	countries	and	your	countries	-	will	make	clear	an important	fact;	namely,	that	injustice	is	inflicted	on	us	and	on	you	by	your politicians,	who	send	your	sons	-	although	you	are	opposed	to	this	-	to	our countries	to	kill	and	be	killed.

Therefore,	it	is	in	both	sides'	interest	to	curb	the	plans	of	those	who	shed	the blood	of	peoples	for	their	narrow	personal	interest	and	subservience	to	the	White House	gang.

The	Zionist	lobby	is	one	of	the	most	dangerous	and	most	difficult	figures	of	this group.

God	willing,	we	are	determined	to	fight	them.	We	must	take	into	consideration that	this	war	brings	billions	of	dollars	in	profit	to	the	major	companies,	whether it	be	those	that	produce	weapons	or	those	that	contribute	to	reconstruction,	such as	the	Halliburton	Company, 3 	its	sisters	and	daughters.

Based	on	this,	it	is	very	clear	who	is	the	one	benefiting	from	igniting	this	war and	from	the	shedding	of	blood.	It	is	the	warlords,	the	bloodsuckers,	who	are steering	the	world	policy	from	behind	a	curtain.

As	for	President	Bush:	the	leaders	who	are	revolving	in	his	orbit,	the	leading media	companies	and	the	United	Nations,	which	makes	laws	for	relations between	the	masters	of	veto 4 	and	the	slaves	of	the	General	Assembly	-	these	are only	some	of	the	tools	used	to	deceive	and	exploit	peoples.	All	these	pose	a	fatal threat	to	the	whole	world.

Based	on	the	above,	and	in	order	to	deny	war	merchants	a	chance	-	and	in response	to	the	positive	interaction	shown	by	recent	events	and	opinion	polls, which	indicate	that	most	European	peoples	want	peace	-	I	ask	honest	people…to form	a	permanent	committee	to	enlighten	European	peoples	of	the	justice	of	our causes,	above	all	Palestine.	They	can	make	use	of	the	huge	potential	of	the media.

The	door	of	reconciliation	is	open	for	three	months	from	the	date	of	announcing this	statement.	I	also	offer	a	reconciliation	initiative	to	them,	whose	essence	is our	commitment	to	stopping	operations	against	every	country	that	commits	itself to	not	attacking	Muslims	or	interfering	in	their	affairs	-	including	the	US conspiracy	on	the	greater	Muslim	world…

The	reconciliation	will	start	with	the	departure	of	its	last	soldier	from	our country.

The	door	of	reconciliation	is	open	for	three	months	from	the	date	of	announcing this	statement.	For	those	who	reject	reconciliation	and	want	war,	we	are	ready…

Stop	shedding	our	blood	so	as	to	preserve	your	blood.	It	is	in	your	hands	to apply	this	easy,	yet	difficult,	formula.	You	know	that	the	situation	will	expand and	increase	if	you	delay	things.	If	this	happens,	do	not	blame	us	-	blame yourselves.	A	rational	person	does	not	relinquish	his	security,	money	and children	to	please	the	liar	of	the	White	House…

It	is	said	that	prevention	is	better	than	cure.	A	happy	person	is	he	who	learns	a lesson	from	the	experience	of	others.	Heeding	right	is	better	than	persisting	in falsehood.

Peace	be	upon	those	who	follow	guidance.
