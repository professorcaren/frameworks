## 'There	can	be	no	whitewash	at	the	White	House'

30	April	1973,	broadcast	from	Washington,	DC,	USA

The	Watergate	scandal	began	on	17	June	1972,	when	police	arrested	five men	who	had	broken	into	the	headquarters	of	the	Democratic	Party	at	the Watergate	building	in	Washington,	DC.	They	were	soon	linked	to	the Republican	Party's	Committee	for	the	Re-election	of	the	President.

Nixon	may	have	had	no	prior	knowledge	of	the	break-in	-	whose perpetrators	had	broken	in	three	weeks	earlier	to	install	bugging	devices	but	quickly	realized	it	could	undermine	his	re-election	chances.	He	therefore ordered	the	FBI	to	halt	its	investigations,	paid	hush	money	to	the	five burglars	and	instructed	his	special	counsel,	John	Dean,	to	conceal	any involvement	by	the	administration.

By	early	1973,	however,	the	conspiracy	of	concealment	was	unravelling.	The

Washington	Post had	already	broken	news	of	the	scandal,	and	in	February	a special	Senate	committee	was	set	up	to	investigate	the	affair.	In	televised hearings,	Dean	accused	Nixon	of	involvement	in	the	cover-up.	Nixon responded	by	firing	Dean;	three	other	aides	swiftly	resigned.

In	this	speech,	broadcast	from	the	Oval	Office	of	the	White	House	at	9pm,	he announced	these	resignations	and	proclaimed	his	innocence.	Nixon	made	a show	of	leadership,	accepting	responsibility	for	mistakes	even	if	they	were not	of	his	making,	and	looking	beyond	the	scandal	to	the	'great	goals'	of peace,	opportunity,	decency	and	civility.	Later,	he	would	be	forced	to	resign over	the	affair.

Good	evening.	I	want	to	talk	to	you	tonight	from	my	heart	on	a	subject	of deep	concern	to	every	American.

In	recent	months,	members	of	my	administration	and	officials	of	the	Committee for	the	Re-election	of	the	President	-	including	some	of	my	closest	friends	and most	trusted	aides	-	have	been	charged	with	involvement	in	what	has	come	to	be known	as	the	Watergate	affair.	These	include	charges	of	illegal	activity	during and	preceding	the	1972	presidential	election	and	charges	that	responsible officials	participated	in	efforts	to	cover	up	that	illegal	activity.

The	inevitable	result	of	these	charges	has	been	to	raise	serious	questions	about the	integrity	of	the	White	House	itself.

Tonight	I	wish	to	address	those	questions.

Last	June	17,	while	I	was	in	Florida	trying	to	get	a	few	days'	rest	after	my	visit to	Moscow, 1 	I	first	learned	from	news	reports	of	the	Watergate	break-in.	I	was appalled	at	this	senseless,	illegal	action,	and	I	was	shocked	to	learn	that employees	of	the	re-election	committee	were	apparently	among	those	guilty.	I immediately	ordered	an	investigation	by	appropriate	government	authorities.	On September	15,	as	you	will	recall,	indictments	were	brought	against	seven defendants	in	the	case.

As	the	investigations	went	forward,	I	repeatedly	asked	those	conducting	the investigation	whether	there	was	any	reason	to	believe	that	members	of	my administration	were	in	any	way	involved.	I	received	repeated	assurances	that there	were	not…

Until	March	of	this	year,	I	remained	convinced	that	the	denials	were	true	and that	the	charges	of	involvement	by	members	of	the	White	House	staff	were	false. The	comments	I	made	during	this	period,	and	the	comments	made	by	my	press secretary	in	my	behalf,	were	based	on	the	information	provided	to	us	at	the	time we	made	those	comments.	However,	new	information	then	came	to	me	which persuaded	me	that	there	was	a	real	possibility	that	some	of	these	charges	were true,	and	suggesting	further	that	there	had	been	an	effort	to	conceal	the	facts	both from	the	public,	from	you,	and	from	me.

As	a	result,	on	March	21,	I	personally	assumed	the	responsibility	for	coordinating	intensive	new	inquiries	into	the	matter,	and	I	personally	ordered	those conducting	the	investigations	to	get	all	the	facts	and	to	report	them	directly	to me,	right	here	in	this	office.

I	again	ordered	that	all	persons	in	the	government	or	at	the	re-election	committee should	co-operate	fully	with	the	FBI,	the	prosecutors,	and	the	grand	jury.	I	also ordered	that	anyone	who	refused	to	co-operate	in	telling	the	truth	would	be asked	to	resign	from	government	service.	And,	with	ground	rules	adopted	that would	preserve	the	basic	constitutional	separation	of	powers	between	the Congress	and	the	presidency,	I	directed	that	members	of	the	White	House	staff should	appear	and	testify	voluntarily	under	oath	before	the	Senate	committee which	was	investigating	Watergate.

I	was	determined	that	we	should	get	to	the	bottom	of	the	matter,	and	that	the truth	should	be	fully	brought	out	-	no	matter	who	was	involved…

Whatever	may	appear	to	have	been	the	case	before,	whatever	improper	activities may	yet	be	discovered	in	connection	with	this	whole	sordid	affair,	I	want	the American	people,	I	want	you	to	know	beyond	the	shadow	of	a	doubt	that	during my	term	as	president,	justice	will	be	pursued	fairly,	fully,	and	impartially,	no matter	who	is	involved.

## This	office	is	a	sacred	trust	and	I	am	determined	to	be worthy	of	that	trust.

Looking	back	at	the	history	of	this	case,	two	questions	arise.	How	could	it	have happened?	Who	is	to	blame?

Political	commentators	have	correctly	observed	that	during	my	27	years	in politics	I	have	always	previously	insisted	on	running	my	own	campaigns	for office.

But	1972	presented	a	very	different	situation.	In	both	domestic	and	foreign policy,	1972	was	a	year	of	crucially	important	decisions,	of	intense	negotiations, of	vital	new	directions,	particularly	in	working	toward	the	goal	which	has	been my	overriding	concern	throughout	my	political	career	-	the	goal	of	bringing peace	to	America,	peace	to	the	world.

That	is	why	I	decided,	as	the	1972	campaign	approached,	that	the	presidency should	come	first	and	politics	second.	To	the	maximum	extent	possible, therefore,	I	sought	to	delegate	campaign	operations,	to	remove	the	day-to-day campaign	decisions	from	the	president's	office	and	from	the	White	House.	I also,	as	you	recall,	severely	limited	the	number	of	my	own	campaign appearances.

Who,	then,	is	to	blame	for	what	happened	in	this	case?

For	specific	criminal	actions	by	specific	individuals,	those	who	committed	those actions	must,	of	course,	bear	the	liability	and	pay	the	penalty.

For	the	fact	that	alleged	improper	actions	took	place	within	the	White	House	or within	my	campaign	organization,	the	easiest	course	would	be	for	me	to	blame those	to	whom	I	delegated	the	responsibility	to	run	the	campaign.	But	that	would be	a	cowardly	thing	to	do.

I	will	not	place	the	blame	on	subordinates	-	on	people	whose	zeal	exceeded	their judgement	and	who	may	have	done	wrong	in	a	cause	they	deeply	believed	to	be right.

In	any	organization,	the	man	at	the	top	must	bear	the	responsibility.	That responsibility,	therefore,	belongs	here	in	this	office.	I	accept	it.	And	I	pledge	to you	tonight,	from	this	office,	that	I	will	do	everything	in	my	power	to	ensure	that the	guilty	are	brought	to	justice	and	that	such	abuses	are	purged	from	our political	processes	in	the	years	to	come,	long	after	I	have	left	this	office.

Some	people,	quite	properly	appalled	at	the	abuses	that	occurred,	will	say	that Watergate	demonstrates	the	bankruptcy	of	the	American	political	system.	I believe	precisely	the	opposite	is	true.	Watergate	represented	a	series	of	illegal acts	and	bad	judgements	by	a	number	of	individuals.	It	was	the	system	that	has brought	the	facts	to	light	and	that	will	bring	those	guilty	to	justice	-	a	system	that in	this	case	has	included	a	determined	grand	jury,	honest	prosecutors,	a courageous	judge,	John	Sirica, 2 	and	a	vigorous	free	press. 3

It	is	essential	now	that	we	place	our	faith	in	that	system	-	and	especially	in	the judicial	system.	It	is	essential	that	we	let	the	judicial	process	go	forward, respecting	those	safeguards	that	are	established	to	protect	the	innocent	as	well	as to	convict	the	guilty.	It	is	essential	that	in	reacting	to	the	excesses	of	others,	we not	fall	into	excesses	ourselves.	It	is	also	essential	that	we	not	be	so	distracted	by events	such	as	this	that	we	neglect	the	vital	work	before	us,	before	this	nation, before	America,	at	a	time	of	critical	importance	to	America	and	the	world.

Since	March,	when	I	first	learned	that	the	Watergate	affair	might	in	fact	be	far more	serious	than	I	had	been	led	to	believe,	it	has	claimed	far	too	much	of	my time	and	my	attention.	Whatever	may	now	transpire	in	the	case,	whatever	the actions	of	the	grand	jury,	whatever	the	outcome	of	any	eventual	trials,	I	must now	turn	my	full	attention	-	and	I	shall	do	so	-	once	again	to	the	larger	duties	of this	office.	I	owe	it	to	this	great	office	that	I	hold,	and	I	owe	it	to	you	-	to	my country…There	is	vital	work	to	be	done	toward	our	goal	of	a	lasting	structure	of peace	in	the	world	-	work	that	cannot	wait,	work	that	I	must	do…

When	I	think	of	this	office	-	of	what	it	means	-	I	think	of	all	the	things	that	I want	to	accomplish	for	this	nation,	of	all	the	things	I	want	to	accomplish	for	you.

On	Christmas	Eve,	during	my	terrible	personal	ordeal	of	the	renewed	bombing of	North	Vietnam 4 	-	which	after	12	years	of	war	finally	helped	to	bring	America peace	with	honour	-	I	sat	down	just	before	midnight.	I	wrote	out	some	of	my goals	for	my	second	term	as	president.	Let	me	read	them	to	you.

'To	make	it	possible	for	our	children,	and	for	our	children's	children,	to	live	in	a world	of	peace.

'To	make	this	country	be	more	than	ever	a	land	of	opportunity	-	of	equal opportunity,	full	opportunity	for	every	American.

'To	provide	jobs	for	all	who	can	work,	and	generous	help	for	those	who	cannot work.

'To	establish	a	climate	of	decency	and	civility,	in	which	each	person	respects	the feelings	and	the	dignity	and	the	God-given	rights	of	his	neighbour.

'To	make	this	a	land	in	which	each	person	can	dare	to	dream,	can	live	his dreams	-	not	in	fear,	but	in	hope	-	proud	of	his	community,	proud	of	his country,	proud	of	what	America	has	meant	to	himself	and	to	the	world.'

These	are	great	goals.	I	believe	we	can,	we	must	work	for	them.	We	can	achieve them.	But	we	cannot	achieve	these	goals	unless	we	dedicate	ourselves	to	another goal.

We	must	maintain	the	integrity	of	the	White	House,	and	that	integrity	must	be real,	not	transparent.	There	can	be	no	whitewash	at	the	White	House.

We	must	reform	our	political	process,	ridding	it	not	only	of	the	violations	of	the law	but	also	of	the	ugly	mob-violence	and	other	inexcusable	campaign	tactics that	have	been	too	often	practised	and	too	readily	accepted	in	the	past,	including those	that	may	have	been	a	response	by	one	side	to	the	excesses	or	expected excesses	of	the	other	side.	Two	wrongs	do	not	make	a	right.

I	have	been	in	public	life	for	more	than	a	quarter	of	a	century.	Like	any	other calling,	politics	has	good	people	and	bad	people.	And	let	me	tell	you,	the	great majority	in	politics	-	in	the	Congress,	in	the	federal	government,	in	the	state government	-	are	good	people.	I	know	that	it	can	be	very	easy,	under	the intensive	pressures	of	a	campaign,	for	even	well-intentioned	people	to	fall	into shady	tactics,	to	rationalize	this	on	the	grounds	that	what	is	at	stake	is	of	such importance	to	the	nation	that	the	end	justifies	the	means.	And	both	of	our	great parties	have	been	guilty	of	such	tactics	in	the	past.

In	recent	years,	however,	the	campaign	excesses	that	have	occurred	on	all	sides have	provided	a	sobering	demonstration	of	how	far	this	false	doctrine	can	take us.

## The	lesson	is	clear:	America,	in	its	political	campaigns, must	not	again	fall	into	the	trap	of	letting	the	end, however	great	that	end	is,	justify	the	means.

I	urge	the	leaders	of	both	political	parties,	I	urge	citizens,	all	of	you,	everywhere, to	join	in	working	toward	a	new	set	of	standards,	new	rules	and	procedures	to ensure	that	future	elections	will	be	as	nearly	free	of	such	abuses	as	they	possibly can	be	made.	This	is	my	goal.	I	ask	you	to	join	in	making	it	America's	goal.

## Yasser	Arafat

## Palestinian	resistance	leader	and	politician

Yasser	Arafat	real	name	Mohammed	Abed	Ar'ouf	(1929-2004)	co-founded	the Al	Fatah	resistance	group	in	1956.	By	1969,	Arafat's	Al	Fatah	group	had	gained control	of	the	Palestinian	Liberation	Organization	(PLO;	founded	in	1964),	and he	became	its	acknowledged	(though	not	universally	popular)	leader.	The organization	was	formally	recognized	by	the	United	Nations	in	1974.	Under Arafat's	leadership,	the	PLO's	original	aim	-	to	create	a	secular	state	over	the whole	of	former	Palestine	-	was	modified	to	one	of	establishing	an	independent state	within	the	territory.	In	1993,	Arafat	and	the	Israeli	prime	minister	Yitzhak Rabin	negotiated	a	peace	agreement	in	the	USA	(signed	in	Cairo	in	1994),	under which	Israel	withdrew	from	Jericho	and	the	Gaza	Strip.

Arafat	returned	as	head	of	a	Palestinian	state	(1994)	and	in	1995	he	negotiated	a Israeli	withdrawal	from	the	West	Bank.	Peace,	however,	proved	increasingly fragile	and	by	2003	Arafat	was	widely	considered	unable	to	control	Arab militancy.	He	died	in	November	2004	of	an	illness	whose	nature	was	disputed.
