## 'We	live	in	a	contaminated	moral	environment'

1	January	1990,	television	and	radio	broadcast	from	Prague,	Czechoslovakia

In	November	1989,	when	the	Communist	Party	relinquished	its	41-year monopoly	of	power	in	Czechoslovakia,	the	dissident	playwright	Václav Havel	remarked,	'History	has	begun	to	develop	very	quickly	in	this	country.' He	was	proved	right	a	month	later	when,	as	leader	of	the	Civic	Forum	party, he	became	the	country's	democratically	elected	president.	Two	days	later,	he addressed	his	compatriots	in	a	broadcast	that	signalled	a	dramatic	change, not	just	in	governance,	but	in	the	national	mood.

Havel	refers	briefly	to	the	environmental	contamination	caused	in Czechoslovakia	-	as	elsewhere	in	the	Eastern	Bloc	-	by	thoughtless industrial	practices.	But	his	central	concern	is	the	moral	contamination brought	about	by	communism:	corruption,	privilege	and	the	deliberate propagation	of	lies.

In	this	he	echoes	the	medieval	Bohemian	martyr	Jan	Hus	(c.1369-1415), whose	statue	stands	in	Prague's	Old	Town	Square.	An	influential	church reformer,	Hus	is	best	known	for	his	prayer:	'Seek	the	Truth/Listen	to	the Truth/Teach	the	Truth/Love	the	Truth/Abide	by	the	Truth/And	defend	the Truth	/Unto	Death.'	Havel	urges	his	listeners	not	to	entertain	denial,	but	to embrace	Czechoslovakia's	contamination	as	'a	sin	we	committed	against ourselves'.

These	concerns	befit	a	writer	concerned	with	ideological	distortions	of	truth and	reality.	But,	although	Havel's	plays	are	abstract	and	cerebral,	his inaugural	address	is	a	direct	and	straight-talking	appeal	to	ordinary	people tasting	freedom	for	the	first	time	in	a	generation.

My	dear	fellow	citizens:	for	40	years,	you	heard	from	my	predecessors	on this	day	different	variations	of	the	same	theme:	how	our	country	flourished,	how many	million	tons	of	steel	we	produced,	how	happy	we	all	were,	how	we	trusted our	government,	and	what	bright	perspectives	were	unfolding	in	front	of	us.

I	assume	you	did	not	propose	me	for	this	office	so	that	I,	too,	would	lie	to	you.

Our	country	is	not	flourishing.	The	enormous	creative	and	spiritual	potential	of our	nations 1 is	not	being	used	sensibly.	Entire	branches	of	industry	are	producing goods	which	are	of	no	interest	to	anyone,	while	we	are	lacking	the	things	we need.	A	state	which	calls	itself	a	workers'	state	humiliates	and	exploits	workers. Our	obsolete	economy	is	wasting	the	little	energy	we	have	available.	A	country that	once	could	be	proud	of	the	educational	level	of	its	citizens	spends	so	little on	education	that	it	ranks	today	as	72nd	in	the	world.	We	have	polluted	our	soil, our	rivers	and	forests,	bequeathed	to	us	by	our	ancestors,	and	we	have	today	the most	contaminated	environment	in	Europe.	Adult	people	in	our	country	die earlier	than	in	most	other	European	countries.

Allow	me	a	little	personal	observation:	when	I	flew	recently	to	Bratislava,	I found	time	during	various	discussions	to	look	out	of	the	plane	window.	I	saw	the industrial	complex	of	Slovnaft	chemical	factory	and	the	giant	Petržalka	housing estate	right	behind	it.	The	view	was	enough	for	me	to	understand	that	for decades	our	statesmen	and	political	leaders	did	not	look	or	did	not	want	to	look out	of	the	windows	of	their	planes.	No	study	of	statistics	available	to	me	would enable	me	to	understand	faster	and	better	the	situation	in	which	we	find ourselves.

But	all	this	is	still	not	the	main	problem.	The	worst	thing	is	that	we	live	in	a contaminated	moral	environment.	We	fell	morally	ill	because	we	became	used	to saying	something	different	from	what	we	thought.	We	learned	not	to	believe	in anything,	to	ignore	each	other,	to	care	only	about	ourselves.	Concepts	such	as love,	friendship,	compassion,	humility,	or	forgiveness	lost	their	depth	and dimensions;	and	for	many	of	us	they	represented	only	psychological peculiarities,	or	they	resembled	gone-astray	greetings	from	ancient	times,	a	little ridiculous	in	the	era	of	computers	and	spaceships.	Only	a	few	of	us	were	able	to cry	out	loud	that	the	powers	that	be	should	not	be	all-powerful,	and	that	special farms,	which	produce	ecologically	pure	and	top-quality	food	just	for	them, should	send	their	produce	to	schools,	children's	homes	and	hospitals	if	our agriculture	was	unable	to	offer	them	to	all.

## The	previous	regime	-	armed	with	its	arrogant	and intolerant	ideology	-	reduced	man	to	a	force	of production	and	nature	to	a	tool	of	production.

In	this	it	attacked	both	their	very	substance	and	their	mutual	relationship.	It reduced	gifted	and	autonomous	people,	skilfully	working	in	their	own	country, to	nuts	and	bolts	of	some	monstrously	huge,	noisy	and	stinking	machine,	whose real	meaning	is	not	clear	to	anyone.	It	cannot	do	more	than	slowly	but inexorably	wear	down	itself	and	all	its	nuts	and	bolts.

When	I	talk	about	contaminated	moral	atmosphere,	I	am	not	talking	just	about the	gentlemen	who	eat	organic	vegetables	and	do	not	look	out	of	the	plane windows.	I	am	talking	about	all	of	us.	We	had	all	become	used	to	the	totalitarian system	and	accepted	it	as	an	unchangeable	fact	and	thus	helped	to	perpetuate	it. In	other	words,	we	are	all	-	though	naturally	to	differing	extents	-	responsible for	the	operation	of	the	totalitarian	machinery;	none	of	us	is	just	its	victim:	we are	all	also	its	co-creators.

Why	do	I	say	this?	It	would	be	very	unreasonable	to	understand	the	sad	legacy of	the	last	40	years	as	something	alien,	which	some	distant	relative	bequeathed us.	On	the	contrary,	we	have	to	accept	this	legacy	as	a	sin	we	committed	against ourselves.	If	we	accept	it	as	such,	we	will	understand	that	it	is	up	to	us	all,	and up	to	us	only,	to	do	something	about	it.	We	cannot	blame	the	previous	rulers	for everything,	not	only	because	it	would	be	untrue	but	also	because	it	could	blunt the	duty	that	each	of	us	faces	today	-	namely,	the	obligation	to	act independently,	freely,	reasonably	and	quickly.

Let	us	not	be	mistaken:	the	best	government	in	the	world,	the	best	parliament and	the	best	president,	cannot	achieve	much	on	their	own.	And	it	would	also	be wrong	to	expect	a	general	remedy	from	them	only.	Freedom	and	democracy include	participation	and	therefore	responsibility	from	us	all.

If	we	realize	this,	then	all	the	horrors	that	the	new	Czechoslovak	democracy inherited	will	cease	to	appear	so	terrible.	If	we	realize	this,	hope	will	return	to our	hearts…

We	are	a	small	country,	yet	at	one	time	we	were	the	spiritual	crossroads	of Europe.	Is	there	any	reason	why	we	could	not	again	become	one?	Would	it	not be	another	asset	with	which	to	repay	the	help	of	others	that	we	are	going	to need?

Our	home-grown	Mafia	-	of	those	who	do	not	look	out	of	plane	windows	and who	eat	specially	fed	pigs	-	may	still	be	around	and	at	times	may	muddy	the waters,	but	they	are	no	longer	our	main	enemy.	Even	less	so	is	our	main	enemy the	international	Mafia.

## Our	main	enemies	today	are	our	own	bad	traits: indifference	to	the	common	good,	vanity,	personal ambition,	selfishness	and	rivalry.

The	main	struggle	will	have	to	be	fought	on	this	field.

There	are	free	elections	and	an	election	campaign	ahead	of	us.	Let	us	not	allow this	struggle	to	dirty	the	so-far	clean	face	of	our	gentle	revolution.	Let	us	not allow	the	sympathies	of	the	world,	which	we	have	won	so	fast,	to	be	equally rapidly	lost	through	our	becoming	entangled	in	the	jungle	of	skirmishes	for power.	Let	us	not	allow	the	desire	to	serve	oneself	to	bloom	once	again	under	the fair	mask	of	the	desire	to	serve	the	common	good.

It	is	not	really	important	now	which	party,	club	or	group	will	prevail	in	the elections.	The	important	thing	is	that	the	winners	will	be	the	best	of	us,	in	the moral,	civic,	political	and	professional	sense,	regardless	of	their	political affiliations.	The	future	policies	and	prestige	of	our	state	will	depend	on	the personalities	we	select	and	later	elect	to	our	representative	bodies…

In	conclusion,	I	would	like	to	say	that	I	want	to	be	a	president	who	will	speak less	and	work	more.

To	be	a	president	who	will	not	only	look	out	of	the	windows	of	his	plane	but who,	first	and	foremost,	will	always	be	present	among	his	fellow	citizens	and listen	to	them	well.

You	may	ask	what	kind	of	a	republic	I	dream	of.	Let	me	reply:	I	dream	of	a republic	independent,	free	and	democratic;	of	a	republic	economically prosperous	and	yet	socially	just;	in	short,	of	a	humane	republic	which	serves	the individual	and	which	therefore	holds	the	hope	that	the	individual	will	serve	it	in turn.	Of	a	republic	of	well-rounded	people	-	because	without	such	it	is impossible	to	solve	any	of	our	problems	-	human,	economic,	ecological,	social or	political.

The	most	distinguished	of	my	predecessors	opened	his	first	speech	with	a quotation	from	the	great	Czech	educator	Komenský. 3 	Allow	me	to	round	off	my first	speech	with	my	own	paraphrase	of	the	same	statement:

People,	your	government	has	returned	to	you!

## Nelson	Mandela

## South	African	lawyer	and	statesman

The	founder	of	South	Africa's	first	legal	practice,	Nelson	Rolihlahla	Mandela (1918-2013)	joined	the	African	National	Congress	(ANC)	in	1944	and	for	the next	20	years	directed	a	campaign	of	defiance	against	the	government	and	its policy	of	apartheid.	In	1964,	he	was	sentenced	to	life	imprisonment	for	political offences	including	sabotage	and	treason,	and	from	his	prison	cell	became	an international	symbol	of	resistance.	The	liberalizing	measures	of	F	W	de	Klerk (1936-),	who	served	as	president	1989-94,	began	the	process	of	dismantling apartheid.	De	Klerk	visited	Mandela	in	prison,	lifted	the	ban	on	the	ANC, removed	restrictions	on	political	groups	and	finally	ordered	Mandela's	release	in February	1990.	In	1991,	Mandela	was	elected	president	of	the	ANC	and	entered into	talks	with	de	Klerk	about	the	country's	future.	In	1993,	Mandela	and	de Klerk	were	joint	winners	of	the	Nobel	Peace	Prize.	Mandela	travelled extensively	to	win	support	for	continued	international	pressure	to	abolish apartheid	completely,	and	on	10	May	1994,	following	South	Africa's	first	multiracial	elections,	he	was	inaugurated	as	South	Africa's	first	black	president,	a	post in	which	he	served	until	1999.
