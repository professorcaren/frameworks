## 'We	dedicate	today	this	Road	of	Valour'

12	December	1948,	Ayalon,	Israel

The	roots	of	this	speech	can	be	traced	back	many	centuries.	The	Jewish people	believe	that	God	promised	them	Canaan	(or	Palestine,	the	land between	the	Jordan	and	the	Mediterranean)	following	their	escape	from Egypt.	Despite	a	period	of	exile,	they	dominated	the	area	until	Roman	times, when	they	were	dispersed,	and	Palestine	became	home	to	Arabs.	Following World	War	I,	Britain	administered	Palestine	under	a	League	of	Nations mandate	(1922-47),	during	which	time	many	Jews	escaped	from	Nazi persecution	to	Palestine.	Jews	and	Arabs	lived	together,	but	calls	for	a	Jewish homeland	provoked	conflict	with	the	majority	Arab	population.

In	November	1947,	the	United	Nations	adopted	a	plan	to	partition	Palestine into	Jewish	and	Arab	states,	each	comprising	sections	linked	by extraterritorial	roads.	The	Arabs	rejected	this	scheme	and	war	broke	out. Roads	linking	Jewish	settlements	ran	through	Arab-controlled	areas, enabling	them	to	control	access.

Operation	Nachshon	began	in	April	1948,	with	the	aim	of	clearing	a	road	to Jerusalem.	After	initial	success,	Jerusalem	was	again	besieged.	On	14	May, David	Ben-Gurion	announced	Israel's	independence;	the	following	day	the

British	mandate	ended	and	Israel	was	invaded	by	her	Arab	neighbours.	A route	through	the	mountains	to	Jerusalem	was	forged	on	9	June,	and following	further	Israeli	military	successes,	the	country's	borders	were largely	secured	by	the	end	of	October.

On	11	December,	UN	Resolution	194	proposed	a	Conciliation	Commission for	the	area,	and	the	following	day	Ben-Gurion	gave	this	rousing	speech, dedicating	the	road	to	Jerusalem	and	celebrating	the	city's	deliverance	by Israeli	troops.

## On	the	road	we	open	today	is	set	the	crown	of	our	fight for	the	homeland	and	freedom.

Into	its	making	went	the	most	tragic	heroism	and	the	greatest	grandeur	of	that fight,	since	the	day	we	were	called	to	face	our	many	enemies	and	save Jerusalem.

This	was	the	heart	and	soul	of	the	War	of	Independence	that	has	raged	over	the country	now	for	more	than	a	year.	It	was,	it	still	is,	a	struggle	in	the	eternal	city 1 and	round	about	it,	and	even	more	a	struggle	for	the	road	to	it.	On	mastery	of	the road	hangs	the	city's	fate.

Our	Third	Return 2 	to	Israel	took	a	course	opposite	to	the	First	and	the	Second.

We	have	come	now	not	westering	from	the	East,	but	from	the	Occident	moving eastward;	not	from	desert	to	sea,	but	from	sea	to	desert.	Of	the	three	regions	of the	land	-	mountains,	lowland	and	valley	-	we	possessed	the	valley	first.	We took	only	little	of	the	lowlands,	and	late.	Of	the	mountains,	we	held	almost nothing	except	for	Jerusalem,	which	in	every	generation	from	every	quarter	drew Jews	to	it.

Within	the	last	century,	this	magnetism	has	turned	Jerusalem	into	a	Jewish metropolis,	with	a	great	and	growing	Jewish	majority.	But	it	also	meant	that Jewish	Jerusalem	stood	severed	from	the	main	centres	of	rural	and	urban settlement,	for	it	was	the	coastal	belt	we	held	for	the	most	part,	and	the	valleys	of Jezreel	and	Jordan,	north	of	Lake	Tiberias	and	south	of	it.	In	normal	times,	the threat	to	Jerusalem	did	not	strike	the	eye.	An	hour's	journey	to	Tel	Aviv	seemed of	little	concern,	so	long	as	it	was	safe.

How	deadly	was	the	danger	soon	appeared	when	the	Arab	states	sought	to encompass	us.	Many	and	bitter	were	the	hurts	our	settlements	endured	in	this War	of	Independence:	the	suffering	of	Jerusalem	alone	was	sevenfold.	Our enemy	knew	the	mortal	stroke	he	might	with	ease	deliver	was	to	seize	and destroy	this	city	of	ours,	distant	from	all	concentrations	of	Jewish	force	and surrounded	on	all	sides	by	a	numerous,	compact	and	daring	Arab	population	in towns	and	villages	whence	every	road	led	to	Jerusalem.

The	Jews	had	only	one	and	almost	its	entire	length	traversed	Arab	areas,	up	hill and	down	dale,	from	Abu	Kebir	near	Tel	Aviv	to	Lifta	at	the	gates	of	Jerusalem.

With	strategic	astuteness,	the	enemy	deployed	his	strength	from	the	start	in	the effort	to	sunder	Jerusalem	from	Tel	Aviv	and	the	lowland,	to	halt	all	Jewish traffic	to	the	city;	and	this	while	the	Mandate	was	still	in	being,	as	long	ago	as December	1947.

The	Mandate	undertook	to	maintain	freedom	of	movement	on	the	road:	its promises	were	not	kept,	and	while	yet	British	troops	garrisoned	Palestine, hunger	and	the	sword	were	menacing	the	Jewish	capital.	The	state	was	still	far off	when	we	realized	that,	unless	unaided	we	could	blast	a	way	through	to Jerusalem	and	occupy	a	sufficient	space	on	either	side	of	this	corridor,	the	city was	doomed	and	our	whole	campaign	might	be	lost.

With	the	incursion	of	Arab	regulars	right	upon	the	Proclamation	of	the	State, 3 the	concentrated	wrath	of	the	enemy	was	vented	upon	Jerusalem,	as	it	was	in	the days	of	the	Prophet	Ezekiel:	'For	the	king	of	Babylon	standeth	at	the	parting	of the	way,	at	the	head	of	the	two	ways,	to	use	divination;	he	shaketh	the	arrows	to and	fro,	he	inquireth	of	teraphim,	he	looketh	in	the	liver.	In	his	right	hand	is	the lot	Jerusalem,	to	set	battering	rams,	to	open	the	mouth	for	the	slaughter,	to	lift	up the	voice	with	shouting,	to	set	battering-rams	against	the	gates,	to	cast	up mounds,	and	to	build	forts.' 4

In	our	days	the	king	of	Babylon 5 	was	joined	by	the	king	of	the	sons	of	Ammon, 6 but	the	army	and	champions	of	Israel,	its	builders	and	engineers,	its	warriors	and workers,	set	the	schemes	of	Babylon	and	Ammon	at	naught;	they	broke	through to	right	and	left,	they	thrust	back	the	invaders	and	scattered	them.	Jerusalem	was liberated	and	a	broad,	untroubled	approach	secured.

Thus,	as	April	began,	our	War	of	Independence	swung	decisively	from	defence to	attack.	Operation	Nachshon,	to	free	the	road,	was	launched	with	the	capture	of Arab	Hulda,	near	where	we	stand	today,	and	of	Dir	Muhsin,	and	culminated	in the	storming	of	Kastel,	the	great	hill-fortress	near	Jerusalem,	where	Abdul	Qader el	Husseini, 7 perhaps	the	only	real	commander	among	the	Arabs	of	Palestine,	fell in	action.

Jerusalem	drew	breath	freely	again,	but	not	for	long:	reinforcements	arrived from	other	Arab	states,	and	it	was	beleaguered	a	second	time.	Upon	it	the	enemy rained	his	fiercest	blows	indiscriminately,	viciously,	night	and	day	without surcease.	British	guns,	primed	by	British	gunners,	bombarded	it.	Our	relief column	was	led	by	a	gallant	and	honoured	American	Jew,	Colonel	David Michael	Marcus. 8

He	was	not	fated,	alas!,	to	enter	the	Jerusalem	he	came	to	free,	and	on	the	very eve	of	the	first	truce,	he	died	in	the	Judean	hills.

Here,	in	the	Valley	of	Ayalon, 9 	the	Defence	Army	of	Israel,	only	just	taking form,	made	its	first	assault	on	the	Arab	lines	at	Latrun.	In	the	van	was	the Seventh	Brigade,	newly	mobilized,	in	the	main	of	men	landed	a	few	days	earlier from	the	detention	camps	of	Cyprus. 10 	Its	units	in	a	brave	engagement	penetrated the	village	and	burned	it	down,	but	were	forced	back	by	massed	artillery.	A Palmach	brigade, 11 	with	typical	courage,	renewed	the	assault,	but	it	too	had	to withdraw,	not	unscathed.	So	the	Arab	Legion	held	the	key	still	to	Sha'ar	Hagai, 12 the	portal	of	the	valley-way,	and	Jerusalem	was	in	the	toils.

It	seemed	as	though	we	had	been	worsted	at	Latrun,	yet	the	fighting	there	in actuality	saved	Jerusalem,	even	before	the	first	truce	gave	it	a	brief	respite,	for we	had	compelled	the	enemy	to	shift	a	large	part	of	his	strength	from	the	city	to the	valley.	The	shelling	was	more	fitful	and	the	citizens	were	heartened	to	hold out	until	the	end.	And	more:	the	fighting	gave	us	a	new	and	open	access	from	the coast	through	the	foothills	to	Jerusalem.

At	the	end	of	May,	the	Eleventh	Brigade	took	Beit	Jiz 13 	and	Beit	Susin 14 	and	the Palmach	entered	Zar'a, 15 	birthplace	of	Samson. 16 	These	actions	hewed	out	the line	of	shock	and	valour	we	call	Burma	Road, 17 	on	to	deliverance	and	the salvation	of	Jerusalem.	Afterwards,	it	was	retraced	along	an	easier	and	apter	line, no	longer	to	be	makeshift	in	emergency	but	an	established	and	enduring	link, flanked	by	multiplying	settlements	that	will	unite	to	form	a	living	bridge	of	men and	husbandry	from	the	principal	zones	of	Jewish	occupancy	and	power	in	the state	to	imperishable	Jerusalem.

As	we	dedicate	today	this	Road	of	Valour,	this	path	of

## deliverance,	let	us	remember	in	deepest	thankfulness the	soldiers	and	workers	in	their	thousands	who	helped in	its	making…

the	battalions	of	infantry	and	the	armoured	cars,	the	artillery	and	the	engineers who	contrived	it,	the	men	who	laid	the	pipeline,	the	men	of	Solel-Boneh, 18 	from Jerusalem	and	Tel	Aviv,	the	stout-hearted	drivers.

They	had	a	proud	share	in	this	feat	of	combat	and	development,	one	that	will	be immortalized	in	the	ageless	annals	of	Zion	set	free,	that	will	be	a	monument	to Jewish	prowess	in	arms	and	in	labour,	the	passport,	now	and	always,	to	victory.

## Albert	Einstein

## German-Swiss-American	scientist

Albert	Einstein	(1879-1955)	achieved	world	fame	through	his	special	and general	theories	of	relativity	(1905	and	1916),	and	won	the	1921	Nobel	Prize	in Physics.	He	ranks	with	Galileo	Galilei	and	Sir	Isaac	Newton	as	one	of	the	great contributors	to	the	understanding	of	the	universe,	but	by	1930	his	best	work	was complete.	After	Adolf	Hitler's	rise	to	power,	he	left	Germany	and	lectured	at Princeton	University,	New	Jersey,	from	1934,	becoming	an	American	citizen and	professor	at	Princeton	in	1940.	In	1939,	he	wrote	to	President	Franklin	D Roosevelt	alerting	him	to	the	possibility	of	constructing	an	atomic	bomb,	thus helping	to	initiate	the	American	effort	to	produce	one.	After	World	War	II, however,	Einstein	urged	international	control	of	atomic	weapons.
