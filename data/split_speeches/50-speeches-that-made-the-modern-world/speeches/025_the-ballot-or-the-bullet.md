## 'The	ballot	or	the	bullet'

3	April	1964,	Cleveland,	Ohio,	USA

This	powerful	speech	is	a	response	to	the	sweeping	events	of	its	time	-	as Malcolm	X	says	here,	1964	'threatens	to	be	the	most	explosive	year	America has	ever	witnessed'.	In	the	run-up	to	the	presidential	elections	in	November, there	was	an	urgent	desire	among	African-Americans	for	President	Lyndon B	Johnson	to	secure	passage	of	the	civil	rights	legislation	proposed	by President	John	F	Kennedy	before	he	was	assassinated.	This	was	partly expressed	in	the	increasing	refusal	of	many	black	people	to	accept	the programme	of	non-violent	protest	endorsed	by	Martin	Luther	King.

Also	in	1964	came	Malcolm's	own	break	from	the	Nation	of	Islam	and	a shift	in	his	stance,	in	recognition	that	the	struggle	for	equality	was	moving from	the	political	to	the	economic	sphere.

Malcolm	urges	assertion	over	compromise;	in	place	of	King's	dream	of multi-racial	harmony,	he	describes	a	'nightmare'	of	segregation	and mistreatment	-	the	only	response	to	which,	he	urges,	must	be	black	unity	and black	action.	Malcolm	borrowed	the	phrase	'the	ballot	or	the	bullet'	from	the 19th-century	abolitionist	leader	Frederick	Douglass,	but	its	roots	go	to	the heart	of	American	history,	and	the	anti-colonial	war	of	liberation	from England.

Mr	Moderator,	Brother	Lomax, 1 	brothers	and	sisters,	friends	and	enemies:	I just	can't	believe	everyone	in	here	is	a	friend,	and	I	don't	want	to	leave	anybody out.	The	question	tonight,	as	I	understand	it,	is	'The	Negro	Revolt,	and	Where Do	We	Go	from	Here?'	or	'What	Next?'	In	my	little	humble	way	of understanding	it,	it	points	toward	either	the	ballot	or	the	bullet…

…I'm	not	here	tonight	to	discuss	my	religion.	I'm	not	here	to	try	and	change your	religion.	I'm	not	here	to	argue	or	discuss	anything	that	we	differ	about, because	it's	time	for	us	to	submerge	our	differences	and	realize	that	it	is	best	for us	to	first	see	that	we	have	the	same	problem,	a	common	problem,	a	problem that	will	make	you	catch	hell	whether	you're	a	Baptist,	or	a	Methodist,	or	a Muslim,	or	a	nationalist.	Whether	you're	educated	or	illiterate,	whether	you	live on	the	boulevard	or	in	the	alley,	you're	going	to	catch	hell	just	like	I	am.	We're all	in	the	same	boat	and	we	all	are	going	to	catch	the	same	hell	from	the	same man.	He	just	happens	to	be	a	white	man…

## All	of	us	have	suffered	here,	in	this	country,	political oppression	at	the	hands	of	the	white	man….

Now	in	speaking	like	this,	it	doesn't	mean	that	we're	anti-white,	but	it	does mean	we're	anti-exploitation,	we're	anti-degradation,	we're	anti-oppression. And	if	the	white	man	doesn't	want	us	to	be	anti-him,	let	him	stop	oppressing	and exploiting	and	degrading	us…

If	we	have	differences,	let	us	differ	in	the	closet.	When	we	come	out	in	front,	let us	not	have	anything	to	argue	about	until	we	get	finished	arguing	with	the	man. If	the	late	President	Kennedy	could	get	together	with	Khrushchev	and	exchange some	wheat, 2 	we	certainly	have	more	in	common	with	each	other	than	Kennedy and	Khrushchev	had	with	each	other.

If	we	don't	do	something	real	soon,	I	think	you'll	have	to	agree	that	we're	going to	be	forced	either	to	use	the	ballot	or	the	bullet.	It's	one	or	the	other	in	1964.	It isn't	that	time	is	running	out	-	time	has	run	out!

Nineteen	sixty-four	threatens	to	be	the	most	explosive	year	America	has	ever witnessed.

The	most	explosive	year.	Why?	It's	a	political	year.	It's	the	year	when	all	of	the white	politicians	will	be	back	in	the	so-called	negro	community,	jiving	you	and me	for	some	votes.	The	year	when	all	of	the	white	political	crooks	will	be	right back	in	your	and	my	community	with	their	false	promises,	building	up	our	hopes for	a	let-down,	with	their	trickery	and	their	treachery,	with	their	false	promises which	they	don't	intend	to	keep.	As	they	nourish	these	dissatisfactions,	it	can only	lead	to	one	thing,	an	explosion;	and	now	we	have	the	type	of	black	man	on the	scene	in	America	today	-	I'm	sorry,	Brother	Lomax	-	who	just	doesn't intend	to	turn	the	other	cheek	any	longer…

I'm	not	a	politician,	not	even	a	student	of	politics;	in	fact,	I'm	not	a	student	of much	of	anything.	I'm	not	a	Democrat.	I'm	not	a	Republican,	and	I	don't	even consider	myself	an	American.	If	you	and	I	were	Americans,	there'd	be	no problem.	Those	honkies 3 	that	just	got	off	the	boat,	they're	already	Americans; Polacks 4 are	already	Americans;	the	Italian	refugees	are	already	Americans. Everything	that	came	out	of	Europe,	every	blue-eyed	thing,	is	already	an American.	And	as	long	as	you	and	I	have	been	over	here,	we	aren't	Americans yet.

Well,	I	am	one	who	doesn't	believe	in	deluding	myself.	I'm	not	going	to	sit	at your	table	and	watch	you	eat,	with	nothing	on	my	plate,	and	call	myself	a	diner. Sitting	at	the	table	doesn't	make	you	a	diner,	unless	you	eat	some	of	what's	on that	plate.	Being	here	in	America	doesn't	make	you	an	American.	Being	born here	in	America	doesn't	make	you	an	American.	Why,	if	birth	made	you American,	you	wouldn't	need	any	legislation;	you	wouldn't	need	any amendments	to	the	Constitution;	you	wouldn't	be	faced	with	civil	rights filibustering	in	Washington,	DC,	right	now.	They	don't	have	to	pass	civil	rights legislation	to	make	a	Polack	an	American.

## No,	I'm	not	an	American.	I'm	one	of	the	22	million black	people	who	are	the	victims	of	Americanism.

One	of	the	22	million	black	people	who	are	the	victims	of	democracy,	nothing but	disguised	hypocrisy…

These	22	million	victims	are	waking	up.	Their	eyes	are	coming	open.	They're beginning	to	see	what	they	used	to	only	look	at.	They're	becoming	politically mature…

- …With	Kennedy	and	Nixon	when	they	ran	for	president,	it	was	so	close	they had	to	count	all	over	again. 5 Well,	what	does	this	mean?	It	means	that	when white	people	are	evenly	divided,	and	black	people	have	a	bloc	of	votes	of	their own:	it	is	left	up	to	them	to	determine	who's	going	to	sit	in	the	White	House	and who's	going	to	be	in	the	dog	house.

It	was	the	black	man's	vote	that	put	the	present	administration	in	Washington, DC.	Your	vote,	your	dumb	vote,	your	ignorant	vote,	your	wasted	vote	put	in	an administration	in	Washington,	DC,	that	has	seen	fit	to	pass	every	kind	of legislation	imaginable,	saving	you	until	last,	then	filibustering	on	top	of	that.

And	your	and	my	leaders	have	the	audacity	to	run	around	clapping	their	hands and	talk	about	how	much	progress	we're	making.	And	what	a	good	president	we have.	If	he	wasn't	good	in	Texas,	he	sure	can't	be	good	in	Washington,	DC… 6

And	these	negro	leaders	have	the	audacity	to	go	and	have	some	coffee	in	the White	House	with	a	Texan,	a	southern	cracker	-	that's	all	he	is	-	and	then	come out	and	tell	you	and	me	that	he's	going	to	be	better	for	us	because,	since	he's from	the	South,	he	knows	how	to	deal	with	the	Southerners.	What	kind	of	logic is	that?	Let	Eastland 7 be	president,	he's	from	the	South	too.	He	should	be	better able	to	deal	with	them	than	Johnson.

In	this	present	administration,	they	have	in	the	House	of	Representatives	257 Democrats	to	only	177	Republicans.	They	control	two-thirds	of	the	House	vote. Why	can't	they	pass	something	that	will	help	you	and	me?	In	the	Senate,	there are	67	senators	who	are	of	the	Democratic	Party.	Only	33	of	them	are Republicans.	Why,	the	Democrats	have	got	the	government	sewed	up,	and you're	the	one	who	sewed	it	up	for	them.

And	what	have	they	given	you	for	it?	Four	years	in	office,	and	just	now	getting around	to	some	civil	rights	legislation…They	get	all	the	negro	vote,	and	after they	get	it,	the	negro	gets	nothing	in	return.	All	they	did	when	they	got	to Washington	was	give	a	few	big	negroes	big	jobs.	Those	big	negroes	didn't	need big	jobs;	they	already	had	jobs.	That's	camouflage,	that's	trickery,	that's treachery,	window-dressing…

That's	why,	in	1964,	it's	time	now	for	you	and	me	to	become	more	politically mature	and	realize	what	the	ballot	is	for;	what	we're	supposed	to	get	when	we cast	a	ballot;	and	that	if	we	don't	cast	a	ballot,	it's	going	to	end	up	in	a	situation where	we're	going	to	have	to	cast	a	bullet.	It's	either	a	ballot	or	a	bullet…

You	don't	need	to	go	to	the	employer	alone,	it	is	the	government	itself,	the government	of	America,	that	is	responsible	for	the	oppression	and	exploitation and	degradation	of	black	people	in	this	country.	And	you	should	drop	it	in	their lap.	This	government	has	failed	the	negro.	This	so-called	democracy	has	failed the	negro.	And	all	these	white	liberals	have	definitely	failed	the	negro…

You	take	the	people	who	are	in	this	audience	right	now.	They're	poor.	We're	all poor	as	individuals.	Our	weekly	salary	individually	amounts	to	hardly	anything. But	if	you	take	the	salary	of	everyone	in	here	collectively,	it'll	fill	up	a	whole	lot of	baskets.	It's	a	lot	of	wealth.	If	you	can	collect	the	wages	of	just	these	people right	here	for	a	year,	you'll	be	rich	-	richer	than	rich.	When	you	look	at	it	like that,	think	how	rich	Uncle	Sam	had	to	become,	not	with	this	handful,	but millions	of	black	people.	Your	and	my	mother	and	father,	who	didn't	work	an eight-hour	shift,	but	worked	from	'can't	see'	in	the	morning	until	'can't	see'	at night,	and	worked	for	nothing,	making	the	white	man	rich,	making	Uncle	Sam rich.	This	is	our	investment.	This	is	our	contribution,	our	blood.

Not	only	did	we	give	of	our	free	labour,	we	gave	of	our	blood.	Every	time	he had	a	call	to	arms,	we	were	the	first	ones	in	uniform.	We	died	on	every battlefield	the	white	man	had.	We	have	made	a	greater	sacrifice	than	anybody who's	standing	up	in	America	today.	We	have	made	a	greater	contribution	and have	collected	less…

I	might	stop	right	here	to	point	out	one	thing.	Whenever	you're	going	after something	that	belongs	to	you,	anyone	who's	depriving	you	of	the	right	to	have it	is	a	criminal.	Understand	that.	Whenever	you	are	going	after	something	that	is yours,	you	are	within	your	legal	rights	to	lay	claim	to	it.	And	anyone	who	puts forth	any	effort	to	deprive	you	of	that	which	is	yours	is	breaking	the	law,	is	a criminal.	And	this	was	pointed	out	by	the	Supreme	Court	decision.	It	outlawed segregation.

Which	means	segregation	is	against	the	law.

Which	means	a	segregationist	is	breaking	the	law.	A	segregationist	is	a	criminal. You	can't	label	him	as	anything	other	than	that.	And	when	you	demonstrate against	segregation,	the	law	is	on	your	side.	The	Supreme	Court	is	on	your	side.

Now,	who	is	it	that	opposes	you	in	carrying	out	the	law?	The	police	department itself.	With	police	dogs	and	clubs.	Whenever	you	demonstrate	against segregation,	whether	it	is	segregated	education,	segregated	housing,	or	anything else,	the	law	is	on	your	side,	and	anyone	who	stands	in	the	way	is	not	the	law any	longer.	They	are	breaking	the	law;	they	are	not	representatives	of	the	law.

Any	time	you	demonstrate	against	segregation	and	a	man	has	the	audacity	to	put a	police	dog	on	you,	kill	that	dog,	kill	him,	I'm	telling	you,	kill	that	dog.	I	say	it, if	they	put	me	in	jail	tomorrow,	kill	that	dog.	Then	you'll	put	a	stop	to	it.	Now,	if these	white	people	in	here	don't	want	to	see	that	kind	of	action,	get	down	and tell	the	mayor	to	tell	the	police	department	to	pull	the	dogs	in.	That's	all	you have	to	do.	If	you	don't	do	it,	someone	else	will.

If	you	don't	take	this	kind	of	stand,	your	little	children	will	grow	up	and	look	at you	and	think	'shame'.	If	you	don't	take	an	uncompromising	stand,	I	don't	mean go	out	and	get	violent;	but	at	the	same	time	you	should	never	be	non-violent unless	you	run	into	some	non-violence.	I'm	non-violent	with	those	who	are	nonviolent	with	me.	But	when	you	drop	that	violence	on	me,	then	you've	made	me go	insane,	and	I'm	not	responsible	for	what	I	do.	And	that's	the	way	every	negro should	get.

Any	time	you	know	you're	within	the	law,	within	your	legal	rights,	within	your moral	rights,	in	accord	with	justice,	then	die	for	what	you	believe	in.	But	don't die	alone.	Let	your	dying	be	reciprocal.

This	is	what	is	meant	by	equality.	What's	good	for	the	goose	is	good	for	the gander…

## Uncle	Sam's	hands	are	dripping	with	blood,	dripping with	the	blood	of	the	black	man	in	this	country.

He's	the	earth's	number-one	hypocrite.	He	has	the	audacity	-	yes,	he	has	imagine	him	posing	as	the	leader	of	the	free	world.	The	free	world!	And	you over	here	singing	'We	Shall	Overcome'.	Expand	the	civil	rights	struggle	to	the level	of	human	rights.	Take	it	into	the	United	Nations,	where	our	African brothers	can	throw	their	weight	on	our	side,	where	our	Asian	brothers	can	throw their	weight	on	our	side,	where	our	Latin-American	brothers	can	throw	their weight	on	our	side,	and	where	800	million	Chinamen	are	sitting	there	waiting	to throw	their	weight	on	our	side.

Let	the	world	know	how	bloody	his	hands	are.	Let	the	world	know	the	hypocrisy that's	practised	over	here.	Let	it	be	the	ballot	or	the	bullet.	Let	him	know	that	it must	be	the	ballot	or	the	bullet.

'Perhaps it is the least understood fact of American political life: the enormous buried violence of women in this country today:
