## 'A	Europe	which	is	free,	democratic,	safe	and	happy'

2	January	1973,	London,	England

Britain's	entry	into	the	European	Community	on	1	January	1973	was	a personal	triumph	for	Edward	Heath.	When	his	predecessor	Harold Macmillan	realized	the	mistake	Britain	had	made	in	refusing	to	join	the European	Economic	Community	in	1957,	Heath	headed	the	negotiating	team that	applied	for	membership	in	1961,	only	to	be	vetoed	by	France.	He	never lost	sight	of	his	ambition,	however,	and	when	the	House	of	Commons	voted by	a	majority	of	112	to	go	into	Europe	in	October	1971,	he	celebrated	by playing	Bach	on	the	organ.	Yet	EC	membership	was	and	continued	to	be	a deeply	divisive	issue:	the	Commons	passed	the	second	reading	of	the European	Communities	Bill	in	February	1972	by	only	eight	votes.

Eleven	months	after	the	second	reading	of	the	European	Communities	Bill, Heath	was	once	again	in	jubilatory	mood,	demonstrated	by	this	speech	given at	a	dinner	at	Hampton	Court	held	by	the	British	Council	of	the	European Movement.	Unlike	future	Conservative	and	Labour	leaders,	he	had	no qualms	over	the	political	and	social,	as	well	as	economic,	aims	of	the European	Community,	'whose	scope	will	gradually	extend	until	it	covers virtually	the	whole	field	of	collective	human	endeavour'.

Divergent	attitudes	towards	Europe	continued	to	be	a	feature	of	future Conservative	governments	and	in	2016	a	referendum	was	held	to	determine whether	or	not	the	UK	should	remain	in	the	European	Union	(as	it	is	now called).	The	result	-	unforeseen	by	most	commentators	-	was	a	vote	to	leave, Some	saw	Heath	as	a	charmless,	awkward	communicator,	but	this	address demonstrates	both	his	sense	of	idealism	and	his	optimism.

Mr	Chairman:	I	am	delighted	to	be	able	to	respond	to	a	toast,	moved	with such	eloquence	by	a	European 1 	who	has	brought	to	this	cause	a	personal conviction,	determination	and	compassion	which	we	deeply	admire.	It	is	fitting that	he	should	be	with	us	here	tonight,	as	we	celebrate	British	entry	into	the Community…

Many	have	worked	with	him	for	this	result,	but	we	recognize	with	gratitude	his own	personal	contribution	which	has	been	so	considerable…

Twenty-five	years	ago,	at	the	first	gathering	of	the	European	Movement 2 	at	The Hague,	Sir	Winston	Churchill	looked	forward	to	the	day	when,	'men	and	women of	every	country	will	think	as	much	of	being	European	as	of	belonging	to	their native	land	and	wherever	they	go	in	this	wide	domain	will	truly	feel,	'Here	I	am at	home'.'

Tonight	as	we	meet	on	the	eve	of	the	'Fanfare	for	Europe'	festival	to	mark British	entry	into	the	Community,	we	are	one	step	nearer	to	making	Churchill's dream	a	reality.

It	is	appropriate	that	here	to	celebrate	this	great	event	there	should	be	not	only	a distinguished	gathering	of	British	people	but	also	a	large	number	of	our	fellow Europeans.	We	welcome	you	all	-	diplomatic	representatives	of	other Community	countries,	presidents	of	the	Community's	institutions	and distinguished	elder	statesmen	of	the	Community,	the	'Fathers	of	Europe'.

The	enlargement	of	the	Community	has	finally	come	about	in	this,	the	25th anniversary	year	of	the	European	Movement.	This	movement	has	provided	much of	the	impetus	towards	European	unity,	and	I	would	like	to	pay	tribute	to	its work	over	these	years.

The	European	Movement	has	brought	together	people	from	very	different political,	social	and	professional	backgrounds,	who	are	united	in	their	belief	that Britain's	future	should	be	one	of	partnership	with	our	European	neighbours.

In	particular	I	would	like	to	thank	the	British	Council	of	the	European Movement	for	their	work	in	preparing	the	way	for	British	entry	into	the Community.

The	meaning	of	our	accomplished	membership	of	the	Community	for	the	British people	themselves	is,	and	is	rightly,	a	preoccupation	of	many	in	this	country.	I would	like	to	pay	tribute	to	all	those	journalists	and	others	responsible	for	the public	media	who	have	done	so	much	in	the	last	few	days	to	ensure,	by	their contributions	in	the	press,	radio	and	elsewhere,	that	the	real	meaning	of membership	is	understood.

We	meet	tonight	in	a	palace	conceived	and	built	by	Cardinal	Wolsey, 3 	a statesman	who	wrestled	with	the	problems	of	Europe	at	a	time	when	nationalism was	in	the	ascendant	throughout	Europe.	Wolsey	sought	to	further	the	interests of	his	church,	his	country	and	his	master	-	but	at	the	same	time	he	tried	to	keep in	check	the	national	rivalries	which	threatened	to	destroy	the	medieval	ideal	of a	Europe	which	was	essentially	one.

The	forces	of	division	proved	too	strong.	Wolsey	lost	his	position,	he	lost	this palace,	he	was	lucky	not	to	lose	his	head.	Europe	entered	on	four	centuries	of bitter	rivalry,	each	phase	of	which	reached	its	climax	in	a	destructive	war.

Now,	in	1973,	we	can	fairly	claim	that	since	the	end	of	the	last	war	there	has been	another	sea	change	in	the	history	of	Europe.	For

## …since	1945	the	story	of	Europe	has	been	essentially one	of	reconciliation	instead	of	rivalry.	In	that	story	the founding	of	the	European	Community	was	one milestone.

The	enlargement	yesterday	of	that	Community	from	six	to	nine	members	was another	milestone	of	equal	importance…

We	have	been	accustomed	during	these	years	to	hear	the	Community	described as	the	Common	Market.	I	hope	that	this	is	a	habit	which	we	can	now	abandon. Certainly	the	unified	market	is	a	fact	of	enormous	significance.	But	it	is	only	the first	step	in	a	journey	which	will	carry	us	well	beyond	questions	of	tariffs	and trade.	For	what	we	are	building	is	a	Community	whose	scope	will	gradually extend	until	it	covers	virtually	the	whole	field	of	collective	human	endeavour.

I	believe	that	the	real	significance	of	last	autumn's	summit	meeting	was precisely	this.	We	were	able	to	agree	on	the	guidelines	for	this	progress	towards a	wider	Community.

We	were	able	to	show	how,	in	one	field	after	another,	we	could	come	together	as neighbours	to	achieve	by	co-operation	the	many	aims	which	we	share	and	which we	could	not	hope	to	realize	in	isolation.	One	of	our	most	important	decisions	at that	meeting	was	that	we	should	work	urgently	towards	building	a	European foreign	policy.	I	believe	that	this	is	not	a	luxury	for	our	Community	but	a	clear necessity.

It	is	a	necessity	if	we	consider	our	relations	with	the	United	States.	I	think	that all	of	us	here	tonight	recognize	the	part	which	the	United	States	has	played	in making	possible	the	creation	of	this	new	Community.	I	am	not	thinking	mainly of	the	economic	help	given	to	Europe	after	the	war,	massive	and	timely	though this	was.	I	am	thinking	rather	of	the	consistent	policy	of	successive administrations	who	have	held	that	it	was	a	fundamental	interest	of	the	United States	that	Europe	should	unite	-	an	interest	which	outweighed	the	increased competition	and	the	occasional	disagreements	with	American	policy	which	a united	Europe	was	bound	to	involve.

In	this	field	we	can	see	most	clearly	how	artificial	is	the	distinction	between foreign	policy	and	economic	policy.	Our	aim	in	Europe	must	be	to	build	up	our own	strength,	and	our	own	Community	of	purpose,	across	the	whole	field	of policy.	Our	aim	must	be	that	Europe	can	emerge	as	a	valid	partner	of	the	United States	in	strengthening	the	prospects	for	peace	and	prosperity	across	the	world…

A	common	policy	is	equally	necessary	in	our	dealings	with	the	Soviet	Union	and with	eastern	Europe.	We	can	see	clearly	enough	that	the	whole	relationship between	eastern	and	western	Europe	is	now	once	again	in	a	state	of	flux.	We welcome	the	progress	which	has	already	been	made	by	the	federal	German government	in	working	out	a	better	relationship	with	its	neighbours.	We	know that	in	the	course	of	1973	there	will	be	further	important	decisions	to	be	taken.

Our	aim	can	be	simply	defined.	It	is	to	enable	both	western	and	eastern	Europe to	make	progress	without	being	held	back	by	mutual	suspicions	or	the	threat	of war.	I	am	sure	that	we	shall	only	succeed	in	this	purpose	if	we	in	western	Europe speak	with	a	common	voice	and	act	with	a	common	energy.	Members	of	the Community,	with	their	uniquely	successful	experience	of	the	policies	of reconciliation,	have	an	important	contribution	to	make	to	a	better	relationship with	eastern	Europe.

## For	we	want	to	build,	as	our	ultimate	objective,	a Europe	which	is	not	only	prosperous	-	but	a	Europe which	is	free,	democratic,	safe	and	happy…

The	political	task	which	faces	us	is	as	ambitious	as	any	yet	undertaken	by	a group	of	nations	acting	together.	And	it	embraces	every	aspect	of	our responsibilities	as	governments	and	as	leaders	of	democratic	political	societies. That	task	requires	us	to	fulfil	the	needs	and	ambitions	of	our	citizens.

We	are,	all	of	us	throughout	the	Community,	increasingly	concerned	to	put	right the	defects	and	injustice	of	modern	society.

As	industry	advances	to	the	greater	prosperity	we	expect,	it	has	imposed	new burdens	on	us	all.	Only	in	the	last	few	years	have	we	become	fully	aware	of	the effects	of	industrial	activity	on	this	scale:	the	ruin	of	the	landscape,	the	pollution of	the	atmosphere,	the	poisoning	of	rivers	and	estuaries…To	stop	this	we	must act	together…

There	is	another	expectation,	yet	more	difficult	to	fulfil.	Throughout	the	nations of	western	Europe,	and	particularly	among	our	young	citizens,	we	have	all noticed	-	and	applauded	-	the	growing	demand	that	the	richer	nations	should work	more	effectively	to	help	the	less	developed	countries,	in	their	struggle	to create	conditions	of	life	compatible	with	human	dignity	and	self-respect…

The	prizes	to	be	gained	by	common	action	are	very	great.	There	is	the	prize	of peace.	There	is	the	prize	of	prosperity.	There	is	the	prize	of	building	in	Europe	a society	which	will	correspond	more	closely	to	the	hopes	of	the	peoples	whom we	represent.	These	have	been	the	aims	which	have	inspired	the	founders	of	the European	Movement.	Today	we	can	see	that	they	are	no	longer	far-off	dreams. They	are	prizes	which	now	lie	within	our	grasp.	We	must	show	the	imagination and	the	strength	of	purpose	to	make	them	our	own.

## Richard	M	Nixon

## American	politician

After	practising	as	a	lawyer,	Richard	Milhous	Nixon	(1913-94)	served	in	the	US Navy	(1942-6),	then	ran	for	Congress	as	a	Republican	in	California.	His	fearless outspokenness	and	tactical	brilliance	boosted	his	political	career,	and	he	was	a prominent	member	of	the	House	Committee	on	Un-American	Activities.	He became	the	Republican	presidential	candidate	in	1960,	losing	narrowly	to	John	F Kennedy,	but	went	on	to	win	the	presidential	election	in	1968	by	a	small	margin. In	1972,	he	was	re-elected	with	a	large	majority.	In	June	1972,	there	was	a burglary	at	the	Democratic	National	Committee's	headquarters	in	the	Watergate building,	Washington,	in	which	Nixon's	re-election	team	was	swiftly	implicated. During	the	official	investigation	which	followed,	Nixon	lost	credibility.	On	9 August	1974,	after	several	leading	members	of	his	government	had	been	found guilty	of	involvement	in	the	Watergate	scandal,	he	resigned,	thus	averting	the threat	of	impeachment.
