## 'To	the	workers,	everything;	to	the	toilers,	everything!'

30	August	1918,	Moscow,	Russia

The	occasion	of	this	speech	was	a	mass	meeting	in	the	hand-grenade	shop	of Moscow's	Michelson	Factory.

Much	had	changed	in	Russia	after	the	February	Revolution	(in	March	1917, by	modern	dating),	which	had	forced	Tsar	Nicholas	II's	abdication	and established	a	provisional	government	of	moderate	reformists.	Although Lenin	-	unwilling	to	compromise	his	careful	plans	to	reorganize	the government	and	economy	-	had	not	taken	advantage	of	anti-government demonstrations	in	July	1917,	he	had	led	the	successful	October	Revolution	a few	months	later.	He	allowed	elections	for	a	constituent	assembly	in November,	but	dissolved	it	in	January	1918	after	the	Socialist	Revolutionary Party	won	a	majority	of	seats.	Russia	withdrew	from	World	War	I	in	March 1918,	ceding	vast	areas	of	land	and	economic	resources	to	Germany	under the	Treaty	of	Brest-Litovsk.

On	15	August,	Lenin	severed	diplomatic	relations	with	the	USA	and	two weeks	later	he	gave	this	speech	discrediting	the	moderate	provisional government	(established	after	the	February	Revolution)	and	attacking	the American	concept	of	democracy.	In	it,	he	expresses	his	anger	at	the	course	of the	war	and	the	treatment	of	workers	in	other	countries.

As	he	was	leaving	the	meeting,	a	member	of	the	Socialist	Revolutionary Party,	Fanya	Kaplan,	ran	towards	him	and	fired	at	close	range.	Lenin	refused to	go	to	hospital	for	fear	that	further	assassins	were	waiting	for	him	there, and	was	treated	at	home.	He	never	fully	recovered	from	his	injuries.

We	Bolsheviks	are	constantly	accused	of	violating	the	slogans	of	equality and	fraternity.	Let	us	go	into	this	question	in	detail.

What	was	the	authority	which	took	the	place	of	the	Tsar's	authority? 1 	It	was	the authority	of	Guchkov 2 	and	Milyukov, 3 	which	began	to	prepare	for	a	constituent assembly	in	Russia.	What	was	it	that	really	lay	behind	this	work	in	favour	of	a liberation	of	the	people	from	its	yoke	of	a	thousand	years?	Simply	the	fact	that Guchkov	and	the	other	leaders	gathered	around	them	a	host	of	capitalists	who were	pursuing	their	own	imperialist	purposes.

And	when	the	clique	of	Kerensky, 4 	Chernov, 5 	etc,	gained	power,	this	new government,	hesitating	and	deprived	of	any	base	to	stand	on,	fought	only	for	the basic	interests	of	the	bourgeoisie,	closely	allied	to	it.	The	power	actually	passed into	the	hands	of	the	kulaks, 6 and	nothing	into	those	of	the	toiling	masses.

We	have	witnessed	the	same	phenomenon	in	other	countries	also.	Let	us	take America,	the	freest	and	most	civilized	country.	America	is	a	democratic republic.	And	what	is	the	result?	We	have	the	shameless	rule	of	a	clique	not	of millionaires	but	of	multi-millionaires,	and	the	entire	nation	is	enslaved	and oppressed.	If	the	factories	and	works,	the	banks	and	all	the	riches	of	the	nation belong	to	the	capitalists;	if,	by	the	side	of	the	democratic	republic	we	observe	a perpetual	enslavement	of	millions	of	toilers	and	a	continuous	poverty,	we	have	a right	to	ask:	where	is	all	your	lauded	equality	and	fraternity?

Far	from	it!	The	rule	of	democracy	is	accompanied	by	an	unadulterated	savage banditry.	We	understand	the	true	nature	of	so-called	democracies.

The	secret	treaties	of	the	French	Republic,	of	England	and	of	the	other democracies, 7 	have	clearly	convinced	us	of	the	real	nature,	the	underlying	facts of	this	business.	Their	aims	and	interests	are	just	as	criminally	predatory	as	are those	of	Germany.	The	war	has	opened	our	eyes.	We	now	know	very	well	that the	'defender	of	the	fatherland'	conceals	under	his	skin	a	vile	bandit	and	thief. This	attack	of	the	bandit	must	be	opposed	with	a	revolutionary	action,	with revolutionary	creativeness.

To	be	sure,	it	is	very	difficult,	at	an	exceptional	time	like	this,	to	bring	about	a union,	particularly	of	the	peasant	revolutionary	elements.	But	we	have	faith	in the	creative	energy	and	the	social	zeal	of	the	vanguard	of	the	revolution	-	the proletariat	of	the	factories	and	shops.	The	workers	have	already	well	grasped	the fact	that,	as	long	as	they	permit	their	minds	to	revel	in	the	phantasms	of	a democratic	republic	and	a	constituent	assembly,	they	will	have	to	hand	out	50 million	roubles	a	day	in	advance	for	military	aims	that	will	be	destructive	to themselves,	and	for	just	so	long	will	it	be	impossible	for	them	to	find	any	outlet from	the	capitalist	oppression.

Having	grasped	this,	the	workers	created	their	soviets. 8 	It	was	life	itself,	real, actual	life,	which	taught	the	workers	to	understand	that	as	long	as	the landholders	had	entrenched	themselves	so	well	in	palaces	and	magic	castles, freedom	of	assembly	would	be	a	mere	fiction	and	would	only	perhaps	be	found in	the	other	world.	To	promise	freedom	to	the	workers	and	at	the	same	time	to leave	the	castles,	the	land,	the	factories	and	all	the	resources	in	the	hands	of	the capitalists	and	landowners	-	that	this	has	nothing	to	do	with	liberty	and	equality.

## We	have	only	one	slogan,	one	watchword:	everyone who	works	has	a	right	to	enjoy	the	good	things	of	life.

Idlers,	parasites,	those	who	suck	out	the	blood	of	the	toiling	masses,	must	be deprived	of	these	blessings.	And	our	cry	is:	to	the	workers,	everything;	to	the toilers,	everything!

We	know	that	all	this	is	difficult	to	bring	about.	We	know	what	savage opposition	we	shall	encounter	on	the	part	of	the	bourgeoisie;	but	we	believe	in the	final	victory	of	the	proletariat;	for	once	it	has	freed	itself	from	the	terrible quandary	of	the	threats	of	military	imperialism	and	once	it	has	erected,	on	the ruins	of	the	structure	it	has	overthrown,	the	new	structure	of	the	socialist republic,	it	cannot	but	gain	the	victory.

And,	as	a	matter	of	fact,	we	find	a	merging	of	forces	in	progress	everywhere. Owing	to	our	abolition	of	private	property	in	land,	we	now	find	an	active fraternization	going	on	between	the	proletariat	of	the	city	and	of	the	village.	The clarification	of	the	class-consciousness	of	the	workers	is	also	advancing	apace	in a	far	more	definite	manner	than	before.

In	the	West	too:	the	workers	of	England,	France,	Italy	and	other	countries	are responding	more	and	more	to	the	appeals	and	demands	which	bear	witness	to	the early	victory	of	the	cause	of	international	revolution.	And	our	task	of	the	day	is this:	that	of	performing	our	revolutionary	work,	regardless	of	all	the	hypocrisy, the	base	shouts	of	rage	and	the	sermons	delivered	by	the	murderous	bourgeoisie. We	must	turn	all	our	efforts	on	the	Czecho-Slovak	front, 9 	in	order	to	disperse	at once	this	band	of	cut-throats	which	cloaks	itself	in	the	slogans	of	liberty	and equality	and	shoots	down	hundreds	and	thousands	of	workers	and	peasants.

We	have	only	one	recourse:	victory	or	death!

## Mahatma	Gandhi

Indian	lawyer	and	statesman

As	leader	of	the	Congress	Movement,	Mohandas	Karamchand	Gandhi,	known	as Mahatma	('Great	Soul')	(1869-1948),	led	a	non-violent	campaign	for	Indian independence	in	the	decades	following	World	War	I,	eventually	realized	in	the Partition	of	August	1947.	Venerated	by	many	as	a	moral	teacher,	reformer	and patriot,	his	critics	considered	him	a	victim	of	self-delusion,	which	blinded	him	to the	bloodshed	provoked	by	his	supposedly	non-violent	campaigns.	Gandhi	was assassinated	in	Delhi	by	a	Hindu	fanatic	on	30	January	1948.
