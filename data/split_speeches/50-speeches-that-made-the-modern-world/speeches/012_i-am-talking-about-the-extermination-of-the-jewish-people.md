## 'I	am	talking	about…the	extermination	of	the	Jewish people'

4	October	1943,	Posen	(Poznań),	Poland

This	horrifying	speech	illuminates	the	steady	development	of	the	Nazi genocide	project.	The	official	persecution	of	German	Jews	-	and	the establishment	of	concentration	camps	to	house	'enemies	of	the	state'	-	began soon	after	Hitler's	appointment	as	chancellor	in	1933.	The	Nazi	Party	itself was	purged	in	1934,	and	the	Nuremberg	Laws	of	September	1935	denied German	citizenship	to	Jews	and	other	'non-Aryans'.	On	Kristallnacht	('night of	crystals')	in	November	1938,	Jewish	businesses	were	ransacked,	looted and	burned.	Concentration	camps	became	extermination	centres	following the	Wannsee	Conference	in	January	1942,	at	which	Nazi	leaders	discussed the	destruction	of	all	European	Jews	-	the	'Final	Solution	to	the	Jewish

## Question'.

However,	the	enormity	of	this	plan	was	daunting,	practically	as	well	as morally.	In	a	three-hour	speech	to	SS	officers	in	Nazi-occupied	Poland, Himmler	demanded	the	suppression	of	squeamishness	and	mercy.	He	also emphasized	the	need	for	discipline	and	secrecy,	thus	implicating	his	deputies in	the	crime	of	the	Holocaust.	Yet,	despite	the	clandestine	circumstances,	he had	the	meeting	tape-recorded,	even	interrupting	his	speech	to	ensure	that	the recorder	was	working.	The	tapes	later	fell	into	the	hands	of	the	US	military and	were	preserved	as	evidence	of	Nazi	war	crimes.	This	is	a	short	extract from	the	transcript.

I	want	to	mention	a	very	difficult	subject	before	you,	with	complete	candour. It	should	be	discussed	amongst	us,	yet	nevertheless,	we	will	never	speak	about	it in	public.	Just	as	we	did	not	hesitate	in	June 	to	carry	out	our	duty	as	ordered, 1 and	stand	comrades	who	had	failed	against	the	wall	and	shoot	them	-	about which	we	have	never	spoken,	and	never	will	speak.	That	was,	thank	God,	a	kind of	tact	natural	to	us,	a	foregone	conclusion	of	that	tact,	that	we	have	never conversed	about	it	amongst	ourselves,	never	spoken	about	it.	Everyone shuddered,	and	everyone	was	clear	that	the	next	time	he	would	do	the	same	thing again,	if	it	were	commanded	and	necessary.

I	am	talking	about	the	evacuation	of	the	Jews,	the	extermination	of	the	Jewish people.

It	is	one	of	those	things	that	is	easily	said.	'The	Jewish	people	is	being exterminated,'	every	party	member	will	tell	you.	'Perfectly	clear:	it's	part	of	our plans.	We're	eliminating	the	Jews,	exterminating	them,	a	small	matter.'

And	then	along	they	all	come,	all	the	80	million	upright	Germans,	and	each	one has	his	decent	Jew.	They	say:	'All	the	others	are	swine,	but	here	is	a	first-class Jew.' [Some	laughter.] And	none	of	them	has	seen	it,	has	endured	it.	Most	of you	will	know	what	it	means	when	100	bodies	lie	together,	when	500	are	there or	when	there	are	1,000.

And	to	have	seen	this	through	and	-	with	the	exception of	human	weakness	-	to	have	remained	decent,	has made	us	hard	and	is	a	page	of	glory	never	mentioned

## and	never	to	be	mentioned.

Because	we	know	how	difficult	things	would	be	if	today	-	in	every	city,	during the	bomb	attacks,	the	burdens	of	war	and	the	privations	-	we	still	had	Jews	as secret	saboteurs,	agitators	and	instigators.

We	would	probably	be	at	the	same	stage	as	in	1916/17,	if	the	Jews	still	resided in	the	body	of	the	German	people.

We	have	taken	away	the	riches	that	they	had,	and	I	have	given	a	strict	order, which	Obergruppenführer	Pohl 2 	has	carried	out.	We	have	delivered	these	riches to	the	Reich,	to	the	State.	We	have	taken	nothing	from	them	for	ourselves.	A few,	who	have	offended	against	this,	will	be	[judged] 3 	in	accordance	with	an order	that	I	gave	at	the	beginning:	he	who	takes	even	one	mark	of	this	is	a	dead man.

A	number	of	SS	men	have	offended	against	this	order.	They	are	very	few,	and they	will	be	dead	men	without	mercy!

## We	have	the	moral	right,	we	had	the	duty	to	our	people to	do	it,	to	kill	this	people	who	would	kill	us.

We,	however,	do	not	have	the	right	to	enrich	ourselves	with	even	one	fur,	with one	mark,	with	one	cigarette,	with	one	watch,	with	anything	that	we	do	not	have.

Because	we	don't	want,	at	the	end	of	all	this,	to	get	sick	and	die	from	the	same bacillus	that	we	have	exterminated.

I	will	never	see	it	happen	that	even	one	bit	of	putrefaction	comes	in	contact	with us,	or	takes	root	in	us.	On	the	contrary,	where	it	might	try	to	take	root,	we	will burn	it	out	together.	But	altogether	we	can	say:	we	have	carried	out	this	most difficult	task	for	the	love	of	our	people.	And	we	have	suffered	no	defect	within us,	in	our	soul,	or	in	our	character.

## Charles	de	Gaulle

## French	military	and	political	leader

At	the	time	of	the	German	invasion	of	France	in	1940,	Charles	André	Joseph Marie	de	Gaulle	(1890-1970)	was	a	general	as	well	as	Under-Secretary	of	War. Days	before	France	signed	an	armistice	with	the	German	invaders	he	sought refuge	in	England	to	found	the	Free	French	Army.	Though	largely	ignored	by both	Winston	Churchill	and	Franklin	D	Roosevelt,	he	served	as	a	focus	for	the resistance	movement	during	the	rest	of	the	war.	He	returned	to	Paris	in	1944 with	the	first	liberation	forces	and	became	the	country's	first	post-war	leader.	To many	British	and	American	politicians,	de	Gaulle	epitomized	Gallic	obstinacy and	self-interest;	but	while	he	could	not	match	Churchill's	brilliance	in	wartime, he	may	be	regarded	as	a	more	influential	and	effective	national	leader	in peacetime.
