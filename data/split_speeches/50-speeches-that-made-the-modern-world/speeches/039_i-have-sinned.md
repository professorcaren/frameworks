## 'I	have	sinned'

11	September	1998,	Washington,	DC,	USA

In	January	1998,	it	was	reported	in	the Washington	Post that	President	Bill Clinton	had	been	involved	in	a	sexual	relationship	with	the	former	White House	intern	Monica	Lewinsky.	Months	of	denials	and	smokescreens followed,	including	First	Lady	Hillary	Clinton's	assertion,	in	a	television interview,	that	there	had	been	a	'vast	right-wing	conspiracy'	against	her husband.

Finally,	on	17	August,	Clinton	admitted	to	an	'improper	physical relationship'	with	Lewinsky,	in	taped	testimony	to	the	Office	of	Independent Counsel	and	the	grand	jury.	That	evening,	he	made	a	brief	televised	address to	the	nation,	in	which	he	offered	a	rather	bullish	apology,	adding:	'I	intend to	reclaim	my	family	life	for	my	family.	It's	nobody's	business	but	ours.'

It	soon	became	apparent	that	Clinton's	approval	ratings	had	not	been impaired,	but	many	commentators	were	not	satisfied	with	his	limited contrition.	The	public	apologies	continued,	but	it	was	not	until	the	annual Religious	Leaders'	Breakfast	at	the	White	House	on	11	September	that Clinton	finally	hit	the	right	tone.

The Time magazine	columnist	Lance	Morrow	wrote	that	Clinton	had 'performed	miserably'	on	17	August,	but	reported	watching	the	Dow	Jones index	steadily	rise	during	the	11	September	speech.	Clinton	had	been nicknamed	'Slick	Willy'	for	his	polished	handling	of	potential embarrassments	-	including	the	much-publicized	investigation	of	the Clintons'	failed	Whitewater	Development	Corporation.	Yet	here	his	delivery is	notably	awkward	and	clumsy.	Was	this	brought	on	by	the	shame	of	a 'broken	spirit',	or	merely	-	as	cynics	suspected	-	a	disingenuous	show	of penitence?

Thank	you	very	much,	ladies	and	gentlemen.	Welcome	to	the	White	House, and	to	this	day,	to	which	Hillary	and	the	Vice	President	and	I	look	forward	so much	every	year.

This	is	always	an	important	day	for	our	country…It	is	an	unusual	and,	I	think, unusually	important	day	today.	I	may	not	be	quite	as	easy	with	my	words	today as	I	have	been	in	years	past,	and	I	was	up	rather	late	last	night	thinking	about	and praying	about	what	I	ought	to	say	today.	And	rather	unusual	for	me,	I	actually tried	to	write	it	down.	So	if	you	will	forgive	me,	I	will	do	my	best	to	say	what	it is	I	want	to	say	to	you	-	and	I	may	have	to	take	my	glasses	out	to	read	my	own writing.

First,	I	want	to	say	to	all	of	you	that,	as	you	might	imagine,

## I	have	been	on	quite	a	journey	these	last	few	weeks	to get	to	the	end	of	this,	to	the	rock-bottom	truth	of	where	I am	and	where	we	all	are.

I	agree	with	those	who	have	said	that	in	my	first	statement	after	I	testified	I	was not	contrite	enough.	I	don't	think	there	is	a	fancy	way	to	say	that	I	have	sinned.

It	is	important	to	me	that	everybody	who	has	been	hurt	know	that	the	sorrow	I feel	is	genuine:	first	and	most	important,	my	family;	also	my	friends,	my	staff, my	Cabinet,	Monica	Lewinsky	and	her	family,	and	the	American	people.	I	have asked	all	for	their	forgiveness.

But	I	believe	that	to	be	forgiven,	more	than	sorrow	is	required	-	at	least	two more	things.	First,	genuine	repentance	-	a	determination	to	change	and	to	repair breaches	of	my	own	making.	I	have	repented.	Second,	what	my	Bible	calls	a

'broken	spirit';	an	understanding	that	I	must	have	God's	help	to	be	the	person that	I	want	to	be;	a	willingness	to	give	the	very	forgiveness	I	seek;	a	renunciation of	the	pride	and	the	anger	which	cloud	judgement,	lead	people	to	excuse	and compare	and	to	blame	and	complain.

Now,	what	does	all	this	mean	for	me	and	for	us?	First,	I	will	instruct	my	lawyers to	mount	a	vigorous	defence,	using	all	available	appropriate	arguments.

But	legal	language	must	not	obscure	the	fact	that	I	have	done	wrong.	Second,	I will	continue	on	the	path	of	repentance,	seeking	pastoral	support	and	that	of other	caring	people	so	that	they	can	hold	me	accountable	for	my	own commitment.

Third,	I	will	intensify	my	efforts	to	lead	our	country	and	the	world	toward	peace and	freedom,	prosperity	and	harmony,	in	the	hope	that	with	a	broken	spirit	and	a still	strong	heart	I	can	be	used	for	greater	good,	for	we	have	many	blessings	and many	challenges	and	so	much	work	to	do.

In	this,	I	ask	for	your	prayers	and	for	your	help	in	healing	our	nation.	And though	I	cannot	move	beyond	or	forget	this	-	indeed,	I	must	always	keep	it	as	a caution	light	in	my	life	-	it	is	very	important	that	our	nation	move	forward.

I	am	very	grateful	for	the	many,	many	people	-	clergy	and	ordinary	citizens alike	-	who	have	written	me	with	wise	counsel.

I	am	profoundly	grateful	for	the	support	of	so	many	Americans,	who	somehow through	it	all	seem	to	still	know	that	I	care	about	them	a	great	deal,	that	I	care about	their	problems	and	their	dreams.	I	am	grateful	for	those	who	have	stood	by me	and	who	say	that	in	this	case	and	many	others,	the	bounds	of	presidency	have been	excessively	and	unwisely	invaded.	That	may	be.

Nevertheless,	in	this	case,	it	may	be	a	blessing,	because	I	still	sinned.	And	if	my repentance	is	genuine	and	sustained,	and	if	I	can	maintain	both	a	broken	spirit and	a	strong	heart,	then	good	can	come	of	this	for	our	country	as	well	as	for	me and	my	family.

## [Applause.]

The	children	of	this	country	can	learn	in	a	profound	way	that	integrity	is important	and	selfishness	is	wrong,	but	God	can	change	us	and	make	us	strong	at the	broken	places.	I	want	to	embody	those	lessons	for	the	children	of	this country	-	for	that	little	boy	in	Florida	who	came	up	to	me	and	said	that	he wanted	to	grow	up	and	be	president	and	to	be	just	like	me. 1 	I	want	the	parents	of all	the	children	in	America	to	be	able	to	say	that	to	their	children.

A	couple	of	days	ago,	when	I	was	in	Florida,	a	Jewish	friend	of	mine	gave	me this	liturgy	book	called	Gates	of	Repentance. 2 	And	there	was	this	incredible passage	from	the	Yom	Kippur 3 	liturgy.	I	would	like	to	read	it	to	you:	'Now	is	the time	for	turning.	The	leaves	are	beginning	to	turn	from	green	to	red	to	orange. The	birds	are	beginning	to	turn	and	are	heading	once	more	toward	the	south.	The animals	are	beginning	to	turn	to	storing	their	food	for	the	winter.	For	leaves, birds	and	animals,	turning	comes	instinctively.	But	for	us,	turning	does	not	come so	easily.	It	takes	an	act	of	will	for	us	to	make	a	turn.	It	means	breaking	old habits.	It	means	admitting	that	we	have	been	wrong,	and	this	is	never	easy.	It means	losing	face.	It	means	starting	all	over	again.	And	this	is	always	painful.	It means	saying	I	am	sorry.	It	means	recognizing	that	we	have	the	ability	to change.	These	things	are	terribly	hard	to	do.

'But	unless	we	turn,	we	will	be	trapped	for	ever	in	yesterday's	ways.

Lord	help	us	to	turn,	from	callousness	to	sensitivity,	from	hostility	to	love,	from pettiness	to	purpose,	from	envy	to	contentment,	from	carelessness	to	discipline, from	fear	to	faith.	Turn	us	around,	O	Lord,	and	bring	us	back	toward	you. Revive	our	lives	as	at	the	beginning,	and	turn	us	toward	each	other,	Lord,	for	in isolation	there	is	no	life.'

I	thank	my	friend	for	that.	I	thank	you	for	being	here.	I	ask	you	to	share	my prayer,	that	God	will	search	me	and	know	my	heart,	try	me	and	know	my anxious	thoughts,	see	if	there	is	any	hurtfulness	in	me,	and	lead	me	toward	the life	everlasting.	I	ask	that	God	give	me	a	clean	heart,	let	me	walk	by	faith	and not	sight.

I	ask	once	again	to	be	able	to	love	my	neighbour	-	all	my	neighbours	-	as myself,	to	be	an	instrument	of	God's	peace;	to	let	the	words	of	my	mouth	and the	meditations	of	my	heart	and,	in	the	end,	the	work	of	my	hands,	be	pleasing. 4 This	is	what	I	wanted	to	say	to	you	today.

Thank	you.	God	bless	you.

## George	W	Bush

## American	politician

George	Walker	Bush	(1946-)	was	the	son	of	the	American	politician	George	H W	Bush,	who	became	the	41st	US	president.	He	was	elected	governor	of	Texas in	1994	and	proved	popular,	winning	re-election	four	years	later.	In	2000,	he stood	as	the	Republican	presidential	candidate	against	Al	Gore,	winning	by	the tightest	margin	for	more	than	a	century.	In	contrast	to	the	left-leaning	presidency of	Bill	Clinton,	Bush	led	a	swing	to	the	right	and	was	closely	associated	with	the Neoconservative	movement	and	the	Christian	Right.	In	September	2001, following	the	terrorist	strikes	on	New	York	and	Washington,	Bush	was	plunged into	the	international	arena	and	became	committed	to	military	action	against perceived	enemies	in	the	Middle	East.	In	2004,	Bush	was	re-elected	president but	faced	a	rising	tide	of	popular	criticism,	especially	for	his	handling	of	the ongoing	Iraq	War,	Hurricane	Katrina	(2005)	and	the	so-called	'Great	Recession' that	began	in	2007.	He	left	office	in	2009.
