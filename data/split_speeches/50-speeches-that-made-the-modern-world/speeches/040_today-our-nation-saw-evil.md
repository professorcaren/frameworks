## 'Today,	our	nation	saw	evil'

11	September	2001,	television	broadcast	from	Washington,	DC,	USA

The	terrorist	strikes	of	11	September	2001	were	unquestionably	a	turning point	in	history,	though	their	significance	may	not	be	fully	understood	for some	years.	They	led	to	war	in	Afghanistan	and	a	raft	of	security	measures and	legislation	under	the	umbrella	title	the	'War	on	Terror'.	They	were	also used	to	justify	the	2003	invasion	of	Iraq.

Bush	was	in	a	classroom	at	Emma	Booker	Elementary	School	in	Florida when	he	was	told	about	the	attacks	in	New	York.	Photographs	and	film footage	show	anguish	settling	over	his	features	as	he	clutches	the	children's book My	Pet	Goat .	He	made	a	brief	media	announcement	from	the	school, then	travelled	to	Louisiana,	where	he	made	a	further	announcement.	By	now, the	World	Trade	Center	had	collapsed,	and	two	further	hijacked	planes	had crashed,	one	destroying	part	of	the	Pentagon	in	Washington.

Bush	returned	to	the	White	House	and	by	8.30pm	he	was	ready	to	address the	nation,	which	he	did	in	this	televised	address	from	the	Oval	Office. Visibly	rattled,	and	stumbling	on	a	few	words,	he	gave	a	competent performance	nonetheless.	This	disaster	was,	in	a	sense,	a	gift	for	Bush:	his hawkish	response	propelled	a	president	formerly	considered	inward-looking into	the	international	arena.

Good	evening.	Today,	our	fellow	citizens,	our	way	of	life,	our	very	freedom came	under	attack	in	a	series	of	deliberate	and	deadly	terrorist	acts.	The	victims were	in	airplanes,	or	in	their	offices;	secretaries,	businessmen	and	women, military	and	federal	workers;	moms	and	dads,	friends	and	neighbours. Thousands	of	lives	were	suddenly	ended	by	evil,	despicable	acts	of	terror.

The	pictures	of	airplanes	flying	into	buildings,	fires	burning,	huge	structures collapsing,	have	filled	us	with	disbelief,	terrible	sadness	and	a	quiet,	unyielding anger.

These	acts	of	mass	murder	were	intended	to	frighten	our	nation	into	chaos	and retreat.	But	they	have	failed;	our	country	is	strong.

A	great	people	has	been	moved	to	defend	a	great	nation.

Terrorist	attacks	can	shake	the	foundations	of	our biggest	buildings,	but	they	cannot	touch	the	foundation of	America.	These	acts	shattered	steel,	but	they	cannot dent	the	steel	of	American	resolve.

America	was	targeted	for	attack	because	we're	the	brightest	beacon	for	freedom and	opportunity	in	the	world.	And	no	one	will	keep	that	light	from	shining.

Today,	our	nation	saw	evil,	the	very	worst	of	human	nature.	And	we	responded with	the	best	of	America	-	with	the	daring	of	our	rescue-workers,	with	the	caring of	-	for	strangers	and	neighbours	who	came	to	give	blood	and	help	in	any	way they	could.

Immediately	following	the	first	attack,	I	implemented	our	government's emergency	response	plans.	Our	military	is	powerful,	and	it's	prepared.	Our emergency	teams	are	working	in	New	York	City	and	Washington,	DC	to	help with	local	rescue	efforts.	Our	first	priority	is	to	get	help	to	those	who	have	been injured,	and	to	take	every	precaution	to	protect	our	citizens	at	home	and	around the	world	from	further	attacks.

The	functions	of	our	government	continue	without	interruption.	Federal	agencies in	Washington	which	had	to	be	evacuated	today	are	reopening	for	essential personnel	tonight,	and	will	be	open	for	business	tomorrow.	Our	financial institutions	remain	strong,	and	the	American	economy	will	be	open	for	business, as	well.

The	search	is	under	way	for	those	who	are	behind	these	evil	acts.	I've	directed the	full	resources	of	our	intelligence	and	law-enforcement	communities	to	find those	responsible	and	to	bring	them	to	justice.	We	will	make	no	distinction between	the	terrorists	who	committed	these	acts	and	those	who	harbour	them.

I	appreciate	so	very	much	the	members	of	Congress	who	have	joined	me	in strongly	condemning	these	attacks.

And	on	behalf	of	the	American	people,	I	thank	the	many	world	leaders	who	have called	to	offer	their	condolences	and	assistance.

America	and	our	friends	and	allies	join	with	all	those	who	want	peace	and security	in	the	world,	and	we	stand	together	to	win	the	war	against	terrorism. Tonight,	I	ask	for	your	prayers	for	all	those	who	grieve,	for	the	children	whose worlds	have	been	shattered,	for	all	whose	sense	of	safety	and	security	has	been threatened.	And	I	pray	they	will	be	comforted	by	a	power	greater	than	any	of	us, spoken	through	the	ages	in	Psalm	23:'Even	though	I	walk	through	the	valley	of the	shadow	of	death,	I	fear	no	evil,	for	you	are	with	me.'

## This	is	a	day	when	all	Americans	from	every	walk	of	life unite	in	our	resolve	for	justice	and	peace.

America	has	stood	down	enemies	before,	and	we	will	do	so	this	time.	None	of	us will	ever	forget	this	day.	Yet	we	go	forward	to	defend	freedom	and	all	that	is good	and	just	in	our	world.

Thank	you.	Good	night,	and	God	bless	America.

## Saddam	Hussein

## Iraqi	dictator

A	member	of	the	Ba'ath	Socialist	Party	since	1957,	Saddam	Hussein	(19372006)	took	a	leading	part	in	the	1968	Iraqi	revolution	and	established	a Revolutionary	Command	Council	(RCC),	of	which	he	became	vice	president, then	chairman	and	state	president	(1979).	He	waged	a	bitter	war	against	Iran (1980-8)	and	dealt	harshly	with	Kurdish	rebels.	In	July	1990,	he	ordered	the invasion	of	Kuwait,	which	led	to	United	Nations	sanctions	and	later	the	Gulf War,	in	which	he	was	opposed	by	a	UN-backed	force	involving	US,	European and	Arab	troops.	Saddam's	army	surrendered	in	February	1991.	Tensions continued	with	the	West,	and	following	the	terrorist	strikes	in	the	USA	in	2001, President	George	W	Bush	identified	Iraq	as	a	member	of	the	'axis	of	evil'	and renewed	demands	for	regime	change.	In	March	2003,	amid	widespread controversy	over	the	legality	of	war,	an	invasion	was	launched	by	a	US-led alliance	of	35	countries.	Decisive	victory	was	accomplished	within	three	weeks, though	insurgency	has	persisted.	Saddam	went	into	hiding	but	was	captured	in December	2003.	His	trial	for	crimes	against	humanity	began	in	July	2004.	He was	convicted	in	November	2006	and	executed	by	hanging	just	under	two months	later.
