## 'We	shall	fight	on	the	beaches'

4	June	1940,	London,	England

The	German	attack	on	northern	Europe	began	on	10	May	1940.	It	had	been expected	since	the	declaration	of	war	by	Britain	and	France	on	3	September 1939,	and	during	the	intervening	months	Allied	commanders	had	drawn	up plans	both	defensive	and	offensive.	When	the	attack	began,	German	Panzer columns	raced	through	Luxembourg,	eastern	Belgium	and	the	Netherlands into	northern	France.	Overwhelmed,	Allied	forces	were	forced	to	retreat, impeded	by	the	surrender	of	the	Belgian	army.	British	and	French	forces fought	to	reach	Dunkirk,	where	they	were	confined	to	a	small	area	and	faced annihilation	after	only	two	weeks'	fighting.	Churchill	prepared	to	make	a speech	to	the	House	explaining	the	prospect	of	defeat.

However,	between	26	May	and	2	June	over	330,000	Allied	troops	were successfully	evacuated	from	the	beaches	in	what	was	called	the	'Miracle	of Dunkirk'.	Although	the	troops	had	to	abandon	most	of	their	equipment,	their safe	return	to	Britain	averted	a	great	catastrophe	and	there	was	national rejoicing.

Churchill's	speech	describes	the	heroic	efforts	of	the	Royal	Navy	and hundreds	of	merchant	seamen	in	evacuating	the	Allied	army,	and	the	Royal Air	Force	for	its	success	in	defending	the	evacuation.	But	it	also	carries	a powerful	message	of	defiance,	preparing	listeners	for	difficult	times	ahead for	Britain,	warning	that	the	struggle	to	overcome	German	aggression	will not	be	easy,	but	assuring	Britain	of	its	ability	to	win	through.	The	speech's eloquence	moved	many	to	tears	-	a	response	shared	by	the	speaker	himself.

When	a	week	ago	today	I	asked	the	House	to	fix	this	afternoon	as	the occasion	for	a	statement,	I	feared	it	would	be	my	hard	lot	to	announce	the greatest	military	disaster	in	our	long	history…The	whole	root	and	core	and	brain of	the	British	army	-	on	which	and	around	which	we	were	to	build	and	are	to build	the	great	British	armies	in	the	later	years	of	the	war	-	seemed	about	to perish	upon	the	field	or	to	be	led	into	an	ignominious	and	starving	captivity.

That	was	the	prospect	a	week	ago.	But	another	blow	which	might	well	have proved	final	was	yet	to	fall	upon	us…

The	surrender	of	the	Belgian	army	compelled	the	British	at	the	shortest	notice	to cover	a	flank	to	the	sea	more	than	30	miles	in	length…It	seemed	impossible	that any	large	number	of	Allied	troops	could	reach	the	coast.

The	enemy	attacked	on	all	sides	with	great	strength	and	fierceness,	and	their main	power,	the	power	of	their	far	more	numerous	air	force,	was	thrown	into	the battle	or	else	concentrated	upon	Dunkirk	and	the	beaches.	Pressing	in	upon	the narrow	exit,	both	from	the	east	and	from	the	west,	the	enemy	began	to	fire	with cannon	upon	the	beaches	by	which	alone	the	shipping	could	approach	or	depart. They	sowed	magnetic	mines	in	the	channels	and	seas;	they	sent	repeated	waves of	hostile	aircraft,	sometimes	more	than	100-strong	in	one	formation,	to	cast their	bombs	upon	the	single	pier	that	remained,	and	upon	the	sand	dunes	upon which	the	troops	had	their	eyes	for	shelter.

Their	U-boats,	one	of	which	was	sunk,	and	their	motor	launches	took	their	toll	of the	vast	traffic	which	now	began.	For	four	or	five	days,	an	intense	struggle reigned.	All	their	armoured	divisions	-	or	what	was	left	of	them	-	together	with great	masses	of	infantry	and	artillery,	hurled	themselves	in	vain	upon	the	evernarrowing,	ever-contracting	appendix	within	which	the	British	and	French armies	fought.

Meanwhile,	the	Royal	Navy,	with	the	willing	help	of	countless	merchant seamen,	strained	every	nerve	to	embark	the	British	and	Allied	troops;	220	light warships	and	650	other	vessels	were	engaged.	They	had	to	operate	upon	the difficult	coast,	often	in	adverse	weather,	under	an	almost	ceaseless	hail	of	bombs and	an	increasing	concentration	of	artillery	fire.	Nor	were	the	seas,	as	I	have said,	themselves	free	from	mines	and	torpedoes.

It	was	in	conditions	such	as	these	that	our	men	carried	on,	with	little	or	no	rest, for	days	and	nights	on	end,	making	trip	after	trip	across	the	dangerous	waters, bringing	with	them	always	men	whom	they	had	rescued.	The	numbers	they	have brought	back	are	the	measure	of	their	devotion	and	their	courage.	The	hospital ships,	which	brought	off	many	thousands	of	British	and	French	wounded,	being so	plainly	marked,	were	a	special	target	for	Nazi	bombs;	but	the	men	and	women on	board	them	never	faltered	in	their	duty.

Meanwhile,	the	Royal	Air	Force,	which	had	already	been	intervening	in	the battle,	so	far	as	its	range	would	allow	from	home	bases,	now	used	part	of	its main	metropolitan	fighter	strength	and	struck	at	the	German	bombers,	and	at	the fighters	which	in	large	numbers	protected	them.	This	struggle	was	protracted	and fierce.

Suddenly	the	scene	has	cleared,	the	crash	and	thunder	has	for	the	moment	-	but only	for	the	moment	-	died	away.

## A	miracle	of	deliverance,	achieved	by	valour,	by perseverance,	by	perfect	discipline,	by	faultless	service, by	resource,	by	skill,	by	unconquerable	fidelity,	is manifest	to	us	all…

We	must	be	very	careful	not	to	assign	to	this	deliverance	the	attributes	of	a victory.	Wars	are	not	won	by	evacuations.	But	there	was	a	victory	inside	this deliverance,	which	should	be	noted…

This	was	a	great	trial	of	strength	between	the	British	and	German	air	forces.

Can	you	conceive	a	greater	objective	for	the	Germans	in	the	air	than	to	make evacuation	from	these	beaches	impossible,	and	to	sink	all	these	ships	which	were displayed,	almost	to	the	extent	of	thousands?	Could	there	have	been	an	objective of	greater	military	importance	and	significance	for	the	whole	purpose	of	the	war than	this?	They	tried	hard,	and	they	were	beaten	back;	they	were	frustrated	in their	task.

We	got	the	army	away;	and	they	have	paid	fourfold	for	any	losses	which	they have	inflicted.	Very	large	formations	of	German	aeroplanes	-	and	we	know	that they	are	a	very	brave	race	-	have	turned	on	several	occasions	from	the	attack	of one-quarter	of	their	number	of	the	Royal	Air	Force,	and	have	dispersed	in different	directions.	Twelve	aeroplanes	have	been	hunted	by	two.	One	aeroplane was	driven	into	the	water	and	cast	away,	by	the	mere	charge	of	a	British aeroplane	which	had	no	more	ammunition.	All	of	our	types	-	Hurricane,	the Spitfire	and	the	new	Defiant	-	and	all	our	pilots	have	been	vindicated	as	superior to	what	they	have	at	present	to	face…

There	never	had	been,	I	suppose,	in	all	the	world,	in	all	the	history	of	war,	such an	opportunity	for	youth.	The	Knights	of	the	Round	Table,	the	Crusaders,	all	fall back	into	the	past:	not	only	distant	but	prosaic;	these	young	men,	going	forth every	morn	to	guard	their	native	land	and	all	that	we	stand	for,	holding	in	their hands	these	instruments	of	colossal	and	shattering	power…deserve	our	gratitude, as	do	all	of	the	brave	men	who,	in	so	many	ways	and	on	so	many	occasions,	are ready,	and	continue	ready,	to	give	life	and	all	for	their	native	land…

I	return	to	the	army.	In	the	long	series	of	very	fierce	battles,	now	on	this	front, now	on	that,	fighting	on	three	fronts	at	once…our	losses	in	men	have	exceeded 30,000	killed,	wounded	and	missing.	I	take	occasion	to	express	the	sympathy	of the	House	to	all	who	have	suffered	bereavement	or	who	are	still	anxious…But	I will	say	this	about	the	missing.	We	have	had	a	large	number	of	wounded	come home	safely	to	this	country,	but	I	would	say	about	the	missing	that	there	may	be very	many	reported	missing	who	will	come	back	home,	some	day,	in	one	way	or another…

Against	this	loss	of	over	30,000	men,	we	can	set	a	far	heavier	loss	certainly inflicted	upon	the	enemy.

But	our	losses	in	material	are	enormous…The	best	of	all	we	had	to	give	had gone	to	the	British	Expeditionary	Force,	and	although	they	had	not	the	numbers of	tanks	and	some	articles	of	equipment	which	were	desirable,	they	were	a	very well	and	finely	equipped	army.	They	had	the	first	fruits	of	all	that	our	industry had	to	give,	and	that	is	gone.	And	now	here	is	this	further	delay.	How	long	it	will be,	how	long	it	will	last,	depends	upon	the	exertions	which	we	make	in	this island.

An	effort	the	like	of	which	has	never	been	seen	in	our	records	is	now	being made.	Work	is	proceeding	everywhere,	night	and	day,	Sundays	and	weekdays. Capital	and	labour	have	cast	aside	their	interests,	rights	and	customs	and	put them	into	the	common	stock.	Already	the	flow	of	munitions	has	leapt	forward. There	is	no	reason	why	we	should	not	in	a	few	months	overtake	the	sudden	and serious	loss	that	has	come	upon	us,	without	retarding	the	development	of	our general	programme.

Nevertheless…the	French	army	has	been	weakened,	the	Belgian	army	has	been lost,	a	large	part	of	those	fortified	lines	upon	which	so	much	faith	had	been reposed	is	gone,	many	valuable	mining	districts	and	factories	have	passed	into the	enemy's	possession,	the	whole	of	the	Channel	ports	are	in	his	hands,	with	all the	tragic	consequences	that	follow	from	that,	and	we	must	expect	another	blow to	be	struck	almost	immediately	at	us	or	at	France.	We	are	told	that	Herr	Hitler has	a	plan	for	invading	the	British	Isles…

We	have,	for	the	time	being	in	this	island,	incomparably	more	powerful	military forces	than	we	have	ever	had	at	any	moment	in	this	war	or	the	last.	But	this	will not	continue.	We	shall	not	be	content	with	a	defensive	war.	We	have	our	duty	to our	Ally. 1 We	have	to	reconstitute	and	build	up	the	British	Expeditionary	Force once	again,	under	its	gallant	commander-in-chief,	Lord	Gort.	All	this	is	in	train; but	in	the	interval	we	must	put	our	defences	in	this	island	into	such	a	high	state of	organization	that	the	fewest	possible	numbers	will	be	required	to	give effective	security	and	that	the	largest	possible	potential	of	offensive	effort	may be	realized.

On	this	we	are	now	engaged…

Turning	once	again,	and	this	time	more	generally,	to	the	question	of	invasion,	I would	observe	that	there	has	never	been	a	period	in	all	these	long	centuries	of which	we	boast	when	an	absolute	guarantee	against	invasion,	still	less	against serious	raids,	could	have	been	given	to	our	people…

## There	was	always	the	chance	[of	invasion],	and	it	is	that chance	which	has	excited	and	befooled	the imaginations	of	many	Continental	tyrants.

Many	are	the	tales	that	are	told.	We	are	assured	that	novel	methods	will	be adopted,	and	when	we	see	the	originality	of	malice,	the	ingenuity	of	aggression which	our	enemy	displays,	we	may	certainly	prepare	ourselves	for	every	kind	of novel	stratagem	and	every	kind	of	brutal	and	treacherous	manoeuvre.	I	think	that no	idea	is	so	outlandish	that	it	should	not	be	considered	and	viewed	with	a searching	-	but	at	the	same	time,	I	hope,	with	a	steady	-	eye.	We	must	never forget	the	solid	assurances	of	sea-power	and	those	which	belong	to	air	power	if	it can	be	locally	exercised.

I	have,	myself,	full	confidence	that	if	all	do	their	duty…we	shall	prove	ourselves once	again	able	to	defend	our	island	home,	to	ride	out	the	storm	of	war	and	to outlive	the	menace	of	tyranny,	if	necessary	for	years,	if	necessary	alone.	At	any rate,	that	is	what	we	are	going	to	try	to	do.	That	is	the	resolve	of	His	Majesty's Government	-	every	man	of	them.	That	is	the	will	of	Parliament	and	the nation…

Even	though	large	tracts	of	Europe	and	many	old	and	famous	states	have	fallen or	may	fall	into	the	grip	of	the	Gestapo 2 and	all	the	odious	apparatus	of	Nazi rule,	we	shall	not	flag	or	fail.

We	shall	go	on	to	the	end,	we	shall	fight	in	France,	we	shall	fight	on	the	seas	and oceans,	we	shall	fight	with	growing	confidence	and	growing	strength	in	the	air, we	shall	defend	our	island,	whatever	the	cost	may	be,

…we	shall	fight	on	the	beaches,	we	shall	fight	on	the landing	grounds,	we	shall	fight	in	the	fields	and	in	the streets,	we	shall	fight	in	the	hills;	we	shall	never surrender…

And	even	if	-	which	I	do	not	for	a	moment	believe	-	this	island	or	a	large	part	of it	were	subjugated	and	starving,	then	our	empire	beyond	the	seas,	armed	and guarded	by	the	British	fleet,	would	carry	on	the	struggle,	until	in	God's	good time,	the	new	world,	with	all	its	power	and	might,	steps	forth	to	the	rescue	and the	liberation	of	the	old.

The Red Red and all citizens of the Soviet Union must defend every inch of Soviet soil must fight to the last of blood for our towns and villages, must display the daring, initiative and mental alertness that are inherent in our people Army Navy drop

## Russian	revolutionary	and	leader

After	the	October	Revolution	(1917),	Joseph	Stalin	(1879-1953)	was	appointed Commissar	for	Nationalities	and	a	member	of	the	Politburo.	With	his appointment	as	General	Secretary	to	the	Central	Committee	in	1922,	Stalin stealthily	began	to	build	up	the	power.	After	Lenin's	death	(1924)	he	assumed control	and	set	about	a	reorganization	of	the	USSR's	resources	with	successive five-year	plans.	Stalin	moved	to	'discipline'	those	who	opposed	his	will, bringing	death	by	execution	or	famine	to	some	10	million	peasants	(1932-3). After	his	exclusion	from	the	Munich	Conference	(1938),	Stalin	signed	a	nonaggression	pact	with	Nazi	Germany,	which	allowed	him	to	prepare	for	the German	invasion	of	1941.	Eventually,	the	Germans	were	defeated	in	a	war	of attrition.	In	the	aftermath	of	World	War	II	he	inaugurated	the	'Cold	War'	against all	non-communist	countries,	while	at	home	his	ruthless	purge	of	all	opposition continued.	He	died	in	mysterious	circumstances	in	1953.
