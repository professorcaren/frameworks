## 'I	have	come	bearing	an	olive	branch	and	a	freedom fighter's	gun'

13	November	1974,	New	York	City,	USA

Yasser	Arafat	was	the	first	representative	of	a	non-governmental organization	to	be	invited	to	address	the	General	Assembly	of	the	United Nations.	He	appeared	at	their	New	York	headquarters	wearing	a kaffiyeh headscarf,	with	his	gun-belt	strapped	around	his	waist.	Although	it	is unlikely	that	there	was	a	weapon	in	the	holster,	the	timing	was	remarkable. In	1972,	the	Black	September	Organization	-	believed	to	be	linked	to	the PLO	-	had	murdered	11	Israeli	athletes	at	the	Munich	Summer	Olympics.

In	this	speech,	Arafat	blames	the	troubles	of	the	Middle	East	on	imperialism and	Zionism.	These,	he	says,	conspired	in	the	partition	of	Palestinian	land following	the	Balfour	Declaration	(1917),	by	which	the	British	foreign secretary	Arthur	Balfour	expressed	British	support	for	the	establishment	of	a Jewish	homeland	in	Palestine.	Arafat	seeks	to	legitimize	the	PLO	as	freedom fighters	by	reiterating	the	themes	of	just	cause	and	legitimate	struggle,	and reminds	his	listeners	that	many	of	them	achieved	independence	through similar	colonial	wars.	His	repetition	of	the	word	'exile'	also	has	echoes	in	the Arafat	ends	his	speech	with	a	veiled	threat	of	further	violence.

Despite	this,	he	received	a	standing	ovation	from	most	of	the	audience.	A year	later,	Resolution	3237	granted	the	PLO	observer	status	at	the	UN.	It	was the	first	non-governmental	body	to	be	recognized	in	this	way.

Mr	President:	I	thank	you	for	having	invited	the	Palestinian	Liberation Organization	to	participate	in	this	plenary	session	of	the	United	Nations	General Assembly.	This	is	a	very	important	occasion…

Our	world	aspires	to	peace,	justice,	equality	and	freedom.	It	wishes	that oppressed	nations,	at	present	bent	under	the	weight	of	imperialism,	might	gain their	freedom	and	their	right	to	self-determination.	It	hopes	to	place	the	relations between	nations	on	a	basis	of	equality,	peaceful	coexistence,	mutual	respect	for each	other's	internal	affairs,	secure	national	sovereignty,	independence	and territorial	unity	on	the	basis	of	justice	and	mutual	benefit…

Great	numbers	of	peoples,	including	those	of	Zimbabwe,	Namibia,	South	Africa and	Palestine,	among	many	others,	are	still	victims	of	oppression	and	violence… It	is	imperative	that	the	international	community	should	support	these	peoples	in their	struggles,	in	the	furtherance	of	their	rightful	causes,	in	the	attainment	of their	right	to	self-determination…

[But]	despite	abiding	world	crises,	despite	even	the	gloomy	powers	of backwardness	and	disastrous	wrong,	we	live	in	a	time	of	glorious	change.

An	old	world	order	is	crumbling	before	our	eyes,	as imperialism,	colonialism,	neo-colonialism	and	racism, the	chief	form	of	which	is	Zionism,	ineluctably	perish.

We	are	privileged	to	be	able	to	witness	a	great	wave	of	history	bearing	peoples forward	into	a	new	world	which	they	have	created.	In	that	world	just	causes	will triumph.	Of	that	we	are	confident.

The	question	of	Palestine	belongs	to	this	perspective	of	emergence	and struggle…Present	at	this	very	moment	in	our	midst	are	those	who,	while	they occupy	our	homes,	as	their	cattle	graze	in	our	pastures,	and	as	their	hands	pluck the	fruit	of	our	trees,	claim	at	the	same	time	that	we	are	disembodied	spirits, fictions	without	presence,	without	traditions	or	future…

For	there	are	amongst	you	-	and	here	I	refer	to	the	United	States	of	America	and others	like	it	-	those	who	supply	our	enemy	freely	with	planes	and	bombs	and with	every	variety	of	murderous	weapon.	They	take	hostile	positions	against	us, deliberately	distorting	the	true	essence	of	the	problem.	All	this	is	done	not	only at	our	expense,	but	at	the	expense	of	the	American	people,	and	of	the	friendship we	continue	to	hope	can	be	cemented	between	us	and	this	great	people,	whose history	of	struggle	for	the	sake	of	freedom	we	honour	and	salute.

I	cannot	now	forgo	this	opportunity	to	appeal	from	this	rostrum	directly	to	the American	people,	asking	it	to	give	its	support	to	our	heroic	and	fighting	people.	I ask	it	whole-heartedly	to	endorse	right	and	justice,	to	recall	George	Washington 1 to	mind,	heroic	Washington	whose	purpose	was	his	nation's	freedom	and independence;	Abraham	Lincoln, 2 	champion	of	the	destitute	and	the	wretched; also	Woodrow	Wilson, 3 	whose	doctrine	of	Fourteen	Points	remains	subscribed	to and	venerated	by	our	people…

As	our	discussion	of	the	question	of	Palestine	focuses	upon	historical	roots,	we do	so	because	we	believe	that	any	question	now	exercising	the	world's	concern must	be	viewed	radically,	in	the	true	root	sense	of	that	word,	if	a	real	solution	is ever	to	be	grasped…The	roots	of	the	Palestinian	question	reach	back	into	the closing	years	of	the	19th	century,	in	other	words,	to	that	period	which	we	call	the era	of	colonialism	and	settlement,	as	we	know	it	today.	This	is	precisely	the period	during	which	Zionism	as	a	scheme	was	born;	its	aim	was	the	conquest	of Palestine	by	European	immigrants,	just	as	settlers	colonized,	and	indeed	raided, most	of	Africa…

Just	as	colonialism	and	its	demagogues	dignified	their	conquests,	their	plunder and	limitless	attacks	upon	the	natives	of	Africa	with	appeals	to	a	'civilizing	and modernizing'	mission,	so	too	did	waves	of	Zionist	immigrants	disguise	their purposes	as	they	conquered	Palestine…

Zionist	theology	was	utilized	against	our	Palestinian	people:	the	purpose	was	not only	the	establishment	of	Western-style	settler	colonialism	but	also	the	severing of	Jews	from	their	various	homelands	and	subsequently	their	estrangement	from their	nations.	Zionism	is	an	ideology	that	is	imperialist,	colonialist,	racist;	it	is profoundly	reactionary	and	discriminatory;	it	is	united	with	anti-Semitism	in	its retrograde	tenets	and	is,	when	all	is	said	and	done,	another	side	of	the	same	base coin.	For	when	what	is	proposed	is	that	adherents	of	the	Jewish	faith,	regardless of	their	national	residence,	should	neither	owe	allegiance	to	their	national residence	nor	live	on	equal	footing	with	its	other,	non-Jewish	citizens	-	when that	is	proposed	we	hear	anti-Semitism	being	proposed.

So	the	Zionist	movement	allied	itself	directly	with	world	colonialism	in	a common	raid	on	our	land.	Allow	me	now	to	present	a	selection	of	historical truths	about	this	alliance.

The	Jewish	invasion	of	Palestine	began	in	1881.	Before	the	first	large	wave	of immigrants	started	arriving,	Palestine	had	a	population	of	half	a	million;	most	of the	population	was	either	Muslim	or	Christian,	and	only	20,000	were	Jewish. Every	segment	of	the	population	enjoyed	the	religious	tolerance	characteristic	of our	civilization.	Palestine	was	then	a	verdant	land,	inhabited	mainly	by	an	Arab people	in	the	course	of	building	its	life	and	dynamically	enriching	its	indigenous culture.

Between	1882	and	1917	the	Zionist	movement	settled	approximately	50,000 European	Jews	in	our	homeland.	To	do	that	it	resorted	to	trickery	and	deceit	in order	to	implant	them	in	our	midst.	Its	success	in	getting	Britain	to	issue	the Balfour	Declaration 4 	once	again	demonstrated	the	alliance	between	Zionism	and imperialism.	Furthermore,	by	promising	to	the	Zionist	movement	what	was	not hers	to	give,	Britain	showed	how	oppressive	was	the	rule	of	imperialism.

As	it	was	constituted	then,	the	League	of	Nations	abandoned	our	Arab	people, and	Wilson's	pledges	and	promises	came	to	nought.	In	the	guise	of	a	mandate, British	imperialism	was	cruelly	and	directly	imposed	upon	us,	to	enable	the Zionist	invaders	to	consolidate	their	gains	in	our	homeland…

By	1947	the	number	of	Jews	had	reached	600,000;	they	owned	about	6	per	cent of	Palestinian	arable	land.	The	figure	should	be	compared	with	the	population	of Palestine,	which	at	that	time	was	1,250,000.

As	a	result	of	the	collusion	between	the	mandatory	power	and	the	Zionist movement	and	with	the	support	of	some	countries,	this	General	Assembly	early in	its	history	approved	a	recommendation	to	partition	our	Palestinian homeland…When	we	rejected	that	decision,	our	position	corresponded	to	that	of the	natural	mother	who	refused	to	permit	King	Solomon	to	cut	her	son	in	two when	the	unnatural	mother	claimed	the	child	for	herself	and	agreed	to	his dismemberment.

Furthermore,	even	though	the	partition	resolution	granted	the	colonialist	settlers 54	per	cent	of	the	land	of	Palestine,	their	dissatisfaction	with	the	decision prompted	them	to	wage	a	war	of	terror	against	the	civilian	Arab	population… They	built	their	own	settlements	and	colonies	on	the	ruins	of	our	farms	and	our groves.

The	roots	of	the	Palestine	question	lie	here.	Its	causes	do	not	stem	from	any conflict	between	two	religions	or	two	nationalisms.	Neither	is	it	a	border	conflict between	neighbouring	states.	It	is	the	cause	of	a	people	deprived	of	its homeland,	dispersed	and	uprooted,	and	living	mostly	in	exile	and	in	refugee camps.

With	support	from	imperialist	and	colonialist	Powers,	[Israel]	managed	to	get itself	accepted	as	a	United	Nations	member.	It	further	succeeded	in	getting	the Palestine	question	deleted	from	the	agenda	of	the	United	Nations	and	in deceiving	world	public	opinion	by	presenting	our	cause	as	a	problem	of	refugees in	need	either	of	charity	from	do-gooders,	or	settlement	in	a	land	not	theirs.

Not	satisfied	with	all	this,	the	racist	entity,	founded	on	the	imperialist-colonialist concept,	turned	itself	into	a	base	of	imperialism	and	into	an	arsenal	of	weapons.

This	enabled	it	to	assume	its	role	of	subjugating	the	Arab	people	and	of committing	aggression	against	them,	in	order	to	satisfy	its	ambitions	for	further expansion	on	Palestinian	and	other	Arab	lands.	In	addition	to	the	many	instances of	aggression	committed	by	this	entity	against	the	Arab	States,	it	has	launched two	large-scale	wars,	in	1956	and	1967,	thus	endangering	world	peace	and security.

As	a	result	of	Zionist	aggression	in	June	1967,	the	enemy	occupied	Egyptian Sinai	as	far	as	the	Suez	Canal.	The	enemy	occupied	Syria's	Golan	Heights,	in addition	to	all	Palestinian	land	west	of	the	Jordan.	All	these	developments	have led	to	the	creation	in	our	area	of	what	has	come	to	be	known	as	the	'Middle	East problem'.	The	situation	has	been	rendered	more	serious	by	the	enemy's persistence	in	maintaining	its	unlawful	occupation	and	in	further	consolidating it,	thus	establishing	a	beachhead	for	world	imperialism's	thrust	against	our	Arab nation…

The	fourth	war	broke	out	in	October	1973,	bringing	home	to	the	Zionist	enemy the	bankruptcy	of	its	policy	of	occupation,	expansion	and	its	reliance	on	the concept	of	military	might.	Despite	all	this,	the	leaders	of	the	Zionist	entity	are	far from	having	learned	any	lesson	from	their	experience.	They	are	making preparations	for	the	fifth	war,	resorting	once	more	to	the	language	of	military superiority,	aggression,	terrorism,	subjugation	and,	finally,	always	to	war	in	their dealings	with	the	Arabs…

As	a	son	of	Jerusalem,	I	treasure	for	myself	and	my	people	beautiful	memories and	vivid	images	of	the	religious	brotherhood	that	was	the	hallmark	of	our	holy city	before	it	succumbed	to	catastrophe…Our	revolution	has	not	been	motivated by	racial	or	religious	factors.	Its	target	has	never	been	the	Jew	as	a	person,	but racist	Zionism	and	undisguised	aggression.	In	this	sense,	ours	is	also	a	revolution for	the	Jew	as	a	human	being	as	well.	We	are	struggling	so	that	Jews,	Christians and	Muslims	may	live	in	equality,	enjoying	the	same	rights	and	assuming	the same	duties,	free	from	racial	or	religious	discrimination.

We	do	distinguish	between	Judaism	and	Zionism.	While	we	maintain	our opposition	to	the	colonialist	Zionist	movement,	we	respect	the	Jewish	faith. Today,	almost	one	century	after	the	rise	of	the	Zionist	movement,	we	wish	to warn	of	its	increasing	danger	to	the	Jews	of	the	world,	to	our	Arab	people	and	to world	peace	and	security…

Those	who	call	us	terrorists	wish	to	prevent	world	public	opinion	from discovering	the	truth	about	us	and	from	seeing	the	justice	on	our	faces…

The	difference	between	the	revolutionary	and	the	terrorist	lies	in	the	reason	for which	each	fights.	For

…whoever	stands	by	a	just	cause	and	fights	for	the freedom	and	liberation	of	his	land	from	the	invaders, the	settlers	and	the	colonialists	cannot	possibly	be	called terrorist…

This	is	actually	a	just	and	proper	struggle,	consecrated	by	the	United	Nations Charter	and	by	the	Universal	Declaration	of	Human	Rights.	As	to	those	who fight	against	the	just	causes,	those	who	wage	war	to	occupy,	colonize	and oppress	other	people,	those	are	the	terrorists…

Their	terrorism	fed	on	hatred	and	this	hatred	was	even	directed	against	the	olive tree	in	my	country,	which	has	been	a	proud	symbol	and	which	reminded	them	of the	indigenous	inhabitants	of	the	land,	a	living	reminder	that	the	land	is Palestinian	-	thus	they	sought	to	destroy	it…Their	terrorism	even	reached	our sacred	places	in	our	beloved	and	peaceful	Jerusalem.	They	have	endeavoured	to de-Arabize	it	and	make	it	lose	its	Muslim	and	Christian	character	by	evicting	its inhabitants	and	annexing	it…

Need	one	remind	this	assembly	of	the	numerous	resolutions	adopted	by	it condemning	Israeli	aggressions	committed	against	Arab	countries,	Israeli violations	of	human	rights	and	the	articles	of	the	Geneva	Conventions,	as	well	as the	resolutions	pertaining	to	the	annexation	of	the	city	of	Jerusalem	and	its restoration	to	its	former	status?	The	only	description	for	these	acts	is	that	they are	acts	of	barbarism	and	terrorism.	And	yet,	the	Zionist	racists	and	colonialists have	the	temerity	to	describe	the	just	struggle	of	our	people	as	terror.	Could there	be	a	more	flagrant	distortion	of	truth	than	this?

…I	am	a	rebel	and	freedom	is	my	cause.	I	know	well	that	many	of	you	present here	today	once	stood	in	exactly	the	same	resistance	position	as	I	now	occupy and	from	which	I	must	fight.	You	once	had	to	convert	dreams	into	reality	by your	struggle…Why	therefore	should	I	not	dream	and	hope?	For	is	not revolution	the	making	real	of	dreams	and	hopes?	So	let	us	work	together	that	my dream	may	be	fulfilled,	that	I	may	return	with	my	people	out	of	exile,	there	in Palestine	to	live	with	this	Jewish	freedom-fighter	and	his	partners,	with	this	Arab priest	and	his	brothers,	in	one	democratic	state	where	Christian,	Jew	and	Muslim live	in	justice,	equality,	fraternity	and	progress.	Is	this	not	a	noble	dream?…In my	formal	capacity	as	Chairman	of	the	Palestine	Liberation	Organization	and leader	of	the	Palestinian	revolution,	I	appeal	to	you	to	accompany	our	people	in its	struggle	to	attain	its	right	to	self-determination…

## Today	I	have	come	bearing	an	olive	branch	and	a freedom	fighter's	gun.

Do	not	let	the	olive	branch	fall	from	my	hand.	I	repeat:	do	not	let	the	olive branch	fall	from	my	hand.

## Margaret	Thatcher

## British	politician

Margaret	Hilda	Thatcher	née	Roberts,	later	Baroness	Thatcher	(1925-2013),	was elected	MP	for	Finchley	in	1959	and	joined	the	Shadow	Cabinet	in	1967.	In Edward	Heath's	government	(1970-74)	she	served	as	Secretary	of	State	for Education	and	Science.	She	was	elected	leader	of	the	Conservative	Party	in	1975 and	became	prime	minister	in	May	1979.	In	her	first	administration,	she	reduced inflation,	but	unemployment	rose.	Her	popularity	was	boosted	by	the	recapture of	the	Falkland	Islands	following	the	Argentinian	invasion	of	1982	and	she	was reelected	in	June	1983.	During	her	second	term,	she	placed	greater	emphasis	on the	market	economy.	The	economy	continued	to	grow	during	her	second administration,	but	her	tough	stance	was	unpopular	in	several	quarters.	She	was returned	for	a	third	term	in	1987.	On	the	international	stage,	she	established	a close	friendship	with	US	president	Ronald	Reagan,	won	the	admiration	of	Soviet president	Mikhail	Gorbachev,	and	was	credited	with	helping	end	the	Cold	War. After	1989,	her	leadership	of	the	party	was	challenged	and	in	November	1990 she	resigned.	Much	of	her	economic	legacy	became	common	ground	between the	British	political	parties	after	Tony	Blair	became	Labour	leader	in	1994.
