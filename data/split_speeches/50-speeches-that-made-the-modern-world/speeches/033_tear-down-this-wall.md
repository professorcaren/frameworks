## 'Tear	down	this	wall!'

12	June	1987,	West	Berlin,	West	Germany

On	the	750th	anniversary	of	Berlin's	foundation,	President	Reagan	spoke from	the	city's	Brandenburg	Gate.	This	was,	as	he	acknowledges	in	the speech,	an	echo	of	the	famous	Berlin	address	given	by	John	F	Kennedy	24 years	earlier,	and	included	in	this	book.

As	in	1963,	East	was	divided	from	West	by	the	Berlin	Wall,	but	the circumstances	had	changed.	The	Soviet	premier,	Mikhail	Gorbachev (1931-),	had	begun	to	promote	a	new	policy	of	glasnost,	or	openness. Recognizing	these	developments,	Reagan	challenged	Gorbachev,	in	possibly the	most	famous	words	of	his	presidency,	to	'tear	down	this	wall!'.	Just	over two	years	later,	the	wall	did	indeed	come	down.

Ironically,	the	phrase	was	nearly	omitted	from	the	speech.	Many	advisers believed	it	was	provocative	and	would	raise	false	hopes.	But	Reagan	was determined	to	include	it,	telling	an	aide	on	the	morning	of	his	address,	'The boys	at	State	are	going	to	kill	me,	but	it's	the	right	thing	to	do.'

Chancellor	Kohl, 1 	Governing	Mayor	Diepgen, 2 	ladies	and	gentlemen:	24 years	ago,	President	John	F	Kennedy	visited	Berlin,	speaking	to	the	people	of this	city	and	the	world	at	the	City	Hall.	Well,	since	then	two	other	presidents have	come,	each	in	his	turn,	to	Berlin.	And	today	I	myself	make	my	second	visit to	your	city.

We	come	to	Berlin,	we	American	presidents,	because	it's	our	duty	to	speak,	in this	place,	of	freedom.

But	I	must	confess,	we're	drawn	here	by	other	things	as	well:	by	the	feeling	of history	in	this	city,	more	than	500	years	older	than	our	own	nation;	by	the	beauty of	the	Grunewald	and	the	Tiergarten;	most	of	all,	by	your	courage	and determination.	Perhaps	the	composer,	Paul	Lincke,	understood	something	about American	presidents.	You	see,	like	so	many	presidents	before	me,	I	come	here today	because	wherever	I	go,	whatever	I	do: ich	hab'	noch	einen	Koffer	in Berlin . 3

Our	gathering	today	is	being	broadcast	throughout	western	Europe	and	North America.	I	understand	that	it	is	being	seen	and	heard	as	well	in	the	East.	To those	listening	throughout	eastern	Europe,	I	extend	my	warmest	greetings	and the	goodwill	of	the	American	people.	To	those	listening	in	East	Berlin,	a	special word:	although	I	cannot	be	with	you,	I	address	my	remarks	to	you	just	as	surely as	to	those	standing	here	before	me.	For	I	join	you,	as	I	join	your	fellow countrymen	in	the	West,	in	this	firm,	this	unalterable	belief: es	gibt	nur	ein Berlin . 4

Behind	me	stands	a	wall	that	encircles	the	free	sectors	of	this	city,	part	of	a	vast system	of	barriers	that	divides	the	entire	continent	of	Europe.

From	the	Baltic	south,	those	barriers	cut	across	Germany	in	a	gash	of	barbed wire,	concrete,	dog-runs	and	guard-towers.	Farther	south,	there	may	be	no visible,	no	obvious	wall.	But	there	remain	armed	guards	and	checkpoints	all	the same	-	still	a	restriction	on	the	right	to	travel,	still	an	instrument	to	impose	upon ordinary	men	and	women	the	will	of	a	totalitarian	state.

Yet	it	is	here	in	Berlin	where	the	wall	emerges	most	clearly;	here,	cutting	across your	city,	where	the	news	photo	and	the	television	screen	have	imprinted	this brutal	division	of	a	continent	upon	the	mind	of	the	world.

## Standing	before	the	Brandenburg	Gate,	every	man	is	a German,	separated	from	his	fellow	men.	Every	man	is	a Berliner,	forced	to	look	upon	a	scar.

President	von	Weizsäcker 5 	has	said:	'The	German	question	is	open	as	long	as	the Brandenburg	Gate	is	closed.'	Today	I	say:	as	long	as	this	gate	is	closed,	as	long as	this	scar	of	a	wall	is	permitted	to	stand,	it	is	not	the	German	question	alone that	remains	open,	but	the	question	of	freedom	for	all	mankind.	Yet	I	do	not come	here	to	lament.	For	I	find	in	Berlin	a	message	of	hope,	even	in	the	shadow of	this	wall,	a	message	of	triumph.

In	this	season	of	spring	in	1945,	the	people	of	Berlin	emerged	from	their	air-raid shelters	to	find	devastation.	Thousands	of	miles	away,	the	people	of	the	United States	reached	out	to	help.	And	in	1947	Secretary	of	State	George	Marshall announced	the	creation	of	what	would	become	known	as	the	Marshall	Plan. Speaking	precisely	40	years	ago	this	month,	he	said:	'Our	policy	is	directed	not against	any	country	or	doctrine,	but	against	hunger,	poverty,	desperation,	and chaos.'

In	the	Reichstag,	a	few	moments	ago,	I	saw	a	display	commemorating	this	40th anniversary	of	the	Marshall	Plan.	I	was	struck	by	the	sign	on	a	burnt-out,	gutted structure	that	was	being	rebuilt.	I	understand	that	Berliners	of	my	own generation	can	remember	seeing	signs	like	it	dotted	throughout	the	western sectors	of	the	city.	The	sign	read	simply:	'The	Marshall	Plan	is	helping	here	to strengthen	the	free	world.'	A	strong,	free	world	in	the	West,	that	dream	became real.	Japan	rose	from	ruin	to	become	an	economic	giant.	Italy,	France,	Belgium	virtually	every	nation	in	western	Europe	saw	political	and	economic	rebirth;	the European	Community	was	founded.

In	West	Germany	and	here	in	Berlin,	there	took	place	an	economic	miracle,	the Wirtschaftswunder …From	1950	to	1960	alone,	the	standard	of	living	in	West Germany	and	Berlin	doubled.	Where	four	decades	ago	there	was	rubble,	today	in West	Berlin	there	is	the	greatest	industrial	output	of	any	city	in	Germany	-	busy office	blocks,	fine	homes	and	apartments,	proud	avenues,	and	the	spreading lawns	of	parkland.	Where	a	city's	culture	seemed	to	have	been	destroyed,	today there	are	two	great	universities,	orchestras	and	an	opera,	countless	theatres	and museums.	Where	there	was	want,	today	there's	abundance	-	food,	clothing, automobiles	-	the	wonderful	goods	of	the	Ku'damm. 6 	From	devastation,	from utter	ruin,	you	Berliners	have,	in	freedom,	rebuilt	a	city	that	once	again	ranks	as one	of	the	greatest	on	earth…

In	the	1950s,	Khrushchev 7 	predicted:	'We	will	bury	you.'	But	in	the	West	today, we	see	a	free	world	that	has	achieved	a	level	of	prosperity	and	well-being unprecedented	in	all	human	history.	In	the	communist	world,	we	see	failure, technological	backwardness,	declining	standards	of	health,	even	want	of	the most	basic	kind	-	too	little	food.	Even	today,	the	Soviet	Union	still	cannot	feed itself.	After	these	four	decades,	then,	there	stands	before	the	entire	world	one great	and	inescapable	conclusion:	freedom	leads	to	prosperity.	Freedom	replaces the	ancient	hatreds	among	the	nations	with	comity	and	peace.	Freedom	is	the victor.

And	now	the	Soviets	themselves	may,	in	a	limited	way,	be	coming	to	understand the	importance	of	freedom.	We	hear	much	from	Moscow	about	a	new	policy	of reform	and	openness.	Some	political	prisoners	have	been	released.	Certain foreign	news	broadcasts	are	no	longer	being	jammed.	Some	economic enterprises	have	been	permitted	to	operate	with	greater	freedom	from	state control…

There	is	one	sign	the	Soviets	can	make	that	would	be	unmistakable,	that	would advance	dramatically	the	cause	of	freedom	and	peace.

General	Secretary	Gorbachev, 8 	if	you	seek	peace,	if	you	seek	prosperity	for	the Soviet	Union	and	eastern	Europe,	if	you	seek	liberalization:	come	here	to	this gate!	Mr	Gorbachev,	open	this	gate!	Mr	Gorbachev,	tear	down	this	wall!

I	understand	the	fear	of	war	and	the	pain	of	division	that	afflict	this	continent	and	I	pledge	to	you	my	country's	efforts	to	help	overcome	these	burdens.	To	be sure,	we	in	the	West	must	resist	Soviet	expansion.	So	we	must	maintain	defences of	unassailable	strength.	Yet	we	seek	peace;	so	we	must	strive	to	reduce	arms	on both	sides.	Beginning	ten	years	ago,	the	Soviets	challenged	the	Western	alliance with	a	grave	new	threat,	hundreds	of	new	and	more	deadly	SS-20	nuclear missiles,	capable	of	striking	every	capital	in	Europe. 9 The	Western	alliance responded	by	committing	itself	to	a	counter-deployment	unless	the	Soviets agreed	to	negotiate	a	better	solution;	namely,	the	elimination	of	such	weapons	on both	sides.

For	many	months,	the	Soviets	refused	to	bargain	in	earnestness.	As	the	alliance, in	turn,	prepared	to	go	forward	with	its	counter-deployment,	there	were	difficult days	-	days	of	protests	like	those	during	my	1982	visit	to	this	city	-	and	the Soviets	later	walked	away	from	the	table.

But	through	it	all,	the	alliance	held	firm.	And	I	invite	those	who	protested	then	I	invite	those	who	protest	today	-	to	mark	this	fact:	because	we	remained	strong, the	Soviets	came	back	to	the	table.	And	because	we	remained	strong,	today	we have	within	reach	the	possibility,	not	merely	of	limiting	the	growth	of	arms,	but of	eliminating,	for	the	first	time,	an	entire	class	of	nuclear	weapons	from	the	face of	the	earth.	As	I	speak,	NATO	ministers	are	meeting	in	Iceland 10 	to	review	the progress	of	our	proposals	for	eliminating	these	weapons.	At	the	talks	in Geneva, 11 	we	have	also	proposed	deep	cuts	in	strategic	offensive	weapons…

While	we	pursue	these	arms	reductions,	I	pledge	to	you	that	we	will	maintain	the capacity	to	deter	Soviet	aggression	at	any	level	at	which	it	might	occur.	And	in co-operation	with	many	of	our	allies,	the	United	States	is	pursuing	the	Strategic Defence	Initiative 12 -	research	to	base	deterrence	not	on	the	threat	of	offensive retaliation,	but	on	defences	that	truly	defend;	on	systems,	in	short,	that	will	not target	populations,	but	shield	them.	By	these	means	we	seek	to	increase	the safety	of	Europe	and	all	the	world.

But	we	must	remember	a	crucial	fact:	East	and	West	do	not	mistrust	each	other because	we	are	armed;	we	are	armed	because	we	mistrust	each	other.	And	our differences	are	not	about	weapons	but	about	liberty.	When	President	Kennedy spoke	at	the	City	Hall	those	24	years	ago,	freedom	was	encircled,	Berlin	was under	siege.	And	today,	despite	all	the	pressures	upon	this	city,	Berlin	stands secure	in	its	liberty.	And	freedom	itself	is	transforming	the	globe…

In	Europe,	only	one	nation	and	those	it	controls	refuse	to	join	the	community	of freedom.	Yet	in	this	age	of	redoubled	economic	growth,	of	information	and innovation,	the	Soviet	Union	faces	a	choice.	It	must	make	fundamental	changes, or	it	will	become	obsolete.	Today	thus	represents	a	moment	of	hope.	We	in	the West	stand	ready	to	co-operate	with	the	East	to	promote	true	openness,	to	break down	barriers	that	separate	people,	to	create	a	safer,	freer	world.

And	surely	there	is	no	better	place	than	Berlin,	the	meeting	place	of	East	and West,	to	make	a	start…

And	I	invite	Mr	Gorbachev:	let	us	work	to	bring	the	eastern	and	western	parts	of the	city	closer	together,	so	that	all	the	inhabitants	of	all	Berlin	can	enjoy	the benefits	that	come	with	life	in	one	of	the	great	cities	of	the	world…

In	these	four	decades,	as	I	have	said,	you	Berliners	have	built	a	great	city. You've	done	so	in	spite	of	threats	-	the	Soviet	attempts	to	impose	the	East-mark, the	blockade. 13 Today	the	city	thrives	in	spite	of	the	challenges	implicit	in	the very	presence	of	this	wall.	What	keeps	you	here?	Certainly	there's	a	great	deal	to be	said	for	your	fortitude,	for	your	defiant	courage.	But	I	believe	there's something	deeper,	something	that	involves	Berlin's	whole	look	and	feel	and	way of	life	-	not	mere	sentiment…something	that	speaks	with	a	powerful	voice	of affirmation,	that	says	yes	to	this	city,	yes	to	the	future,	yes	to	freedom.	In	a word,	I	would	submit	that	what	keeps	you	in	Berlin	is	love	-	love	both	profound and	abiding.

Perhaps	this	gets	to	the	root	of	the	matter,	to	the	most	fundamental	distinction	of all	between	East	and	West.

The	totalitarian	world	produces	backwardness	because	it	does	such	violence	to the	spirit,	thwarting	the	human	impulse	to	create,	to	enjoy,	to	worship.	The totalitarian	world	finds	even	symbols	of	love	and	of	worship	an	affront.

Years	ago,	before	the	East	Germans	began	rebuilding	their	churches,	they erected	a	secular	structure:	the	television	tower	at	Alexanderplatz.	Virtually	ever since,	the	authorities	have	been	working	to	correct	what	they	view	as	the	tower's one	major	flaw,	treating	the	glass	sphere	at	the	top	with	paints	and	chemicals	of every	kind.	Yet	even	today	when	the	sun	strikes	that	sphere	-	that	sphere	that towers	over	all	Berlin	-	the	light	makes	the	sign	of	the	cross.	There	in	Berlin, like	the	city	itself,	symbols	of	love,	symbols	of	worship,	cannot	be	suppressed.

As	I	looked	out	a	moment	ago	from	the	Reichstag,	that	embodiment	of	German unity,	I	noticed	words	crudely	spray-painted	upon	the	wall,	perhaps	by	a	young Berliner,	'This	wall	will	fall.	Beliefs	become	reality.'

## Yes,	across	Europe,	this	wall	will	fall.	For	it	cannot withstand	faith;	it	cannot	withstand	truth.	The	wall cannot	withstand	freedom.

And	I	would	like,	before	I	close,	to	say	one	word.	I	have	read,	and	I	have	been questioned	since	I've	been	here,	about	certain	demonstrations	against	my coming.	And	I	would	like	to	say	just	one	thing	to	those	who	demonstrate	so.	I wonder	if	they	have	ever	asked	themselves	that	if	they	should	have	the	kind	of government	they	apparently	seek,	no	one	would	ever	be	able	to	do	what	they're doing	again.

Thank	you	and	God	bless	you	all.

## Václav	Havel

## Czech	writer	and	statesman

In	1977,	the	writer	and	playwright	Václav	Havel	(1936-2011)	was	one	of	the founders	of	Charter	77,	a	movement	which	criticized	violations	of	human	and civil	rights	by	the	communist	regime	in	Czechoslovakia.	Deemed	subversive,	he was	repeatedly	arrested	and	in	1979	was	imprisoned	for	four	and	a	half	years.	He was	again	imprisoned	in	February	1989,	but	was	released	three	months	later.	In December	1989,	after	the	overthrow	of	the	Czechoslovak	Communist	Party during	the	so-called	Velvet	Revolution,	he	was	elected	president	by	direct popular	vote.	He	oversaw	the	peaceful	division	of	Czechoslovakia	into	separate Czech	and	Slovak	states	in	1992	and	was	elected	president	of	the	Czech Republic	in	1993.	He	was	re-elected	in	1998	and	left	office	in	2003.
