## 'The	lady's	not	for	turning'

10	October	1980,	Brighton,	England

Margaret	Thatcher's	keynote	speech	to	the	1980	Conservative	Party conference,	the	middle	section	of	which	is	reproduced	here,	was	a	rousing statement	of	defiance	against	critics	outside	and	within	the	party	who	had attacked	her	government's	counter-inflationary	policies,	blaming	them	for the	growth	in	unemployment.	While	she	acknowledged	the	'human	tragedy' of	Britain's	two	million	unemployed,	she	insisted	that	low	inflation	offered the	only	real	hope	of	long-term	prosperity.	Additional	measures,	she	hinted, were	curbing	the	wastefulness	of	local	authorities	and	nationalized	utilities	measures	which	Thatcher	would	increasingly	effect	during	her	11	years	in office,	limiting	the	powers	of	local	authorities	and	privatizing	the	utility companies.

The	most	famous	line	of	the	speech	-	and	one	of	the	most	memorable	of	her career	-	was	a	direct	riposte	to	commentators	who	were	predicting	that Thatcher	would	be	forced	to	make	a	'U-turn'	on	her	economic	policy,	just	as Edward	Heath's	government	had	been	in	1972.	However,	an	equally	telling moment	-	in	terms	of	the	national	mood	and	the	prime	minister's	mettle	occurred	earlier	in	the	speech,	when	protesters	burst	into	the	conference	hall, shouting	'Tories	out!	We	want	jobs!'.	Thatcher	responded,	to	thunderous applause,	'Never	mind,	it's	wet	outside.	I	expect	they	wanted	to	come	in. You	can't	blame	them;	it's	always	better	where	the	Tories	are.'

The	level	of	unemployment	in	our	country	today	is	a	human	tragedy.	Let	me make	it	clear	beyond	doubt:	I	am	profoundly	concerned	about	unemployment. Human	dignity	and	self-respect	are	undermined	when	men	and	women	are condemned	to	idleness.	The	waste	of	a	country's	most	precious	assets	-	the talent	and	energy	of	its	people	-	makes	it	the	bounden	duty	of	government	to seek	a	real	and	lasting	cure.

## If	I	could	press	a	button	and	genuinely	solve	the unemployment	problem,	do	you	think	that	I	would	not press	that	button	this	instant?

Does	anyone	imagine	that	there	is	the	smallest	political	gain	in	letting	this unemployment	continue,	or	that	there	is	some	obscure	economic	religion	which demands	this	unemployment	as	part	of	its	ritual?	This	government	are	pursuing the	only	policy	which	gives	any	hope	of	bringing	our	people	back	to	real	and lasting	employment…

I	know	that	there	is	another	real	worry	affecting	many	of	our	people.

Although	they	accept	that	our	policies	are	right,	they	feel	deeply	that	the	burden of	carrying	them	out	is	falling	much	more	heavily	on	the	private	than	on	the public	sector.	They	say	that	the	public	sector	is	enjoying	advantages	but	the private	sector	is	taking	the	knocks	and	at	the	same	time	maintaining	those	in	the public	sector	with	better	pay	and	pensions	than	they	enjoy.

I	must	tell	you	that	I	share	this	concern	and	understand	the	resentment.	That	is why	I	and	my	colleagues	say	that	to	add	to	public	spending	takes	away	the	very money	and	resources	that	industry	needs	to	stay	in	business	let	alone	to	expand. Higher	public	spending,	far	from	curing	unemployment,	can	be	the	very	vehicle that	loses	jobs	and	causes	bankruptcies	in	trade	and	commerce.	That	is	why	we warned	local	authorities	that	since	rates	are	frequently	the	biggest	tax	that industry	now	faces,	increases	in	them	can	cripple	local	businesses.	Councils must,	therefore,	learn	to	cut	costs	in	the	same	way	that	companies	have	to. 1

That	is	why	I	stress	that	if	those	who	work	in	public	authorities	take	for themselves	large	pay	increases	they	leave	less	to	be	spent	on	equipment	and	new buildings.	That	in	turn	deprives	the	private	sector	of	the	orders	it	needs, especially	some	of	those	industries	in	the	hard-pressed	regions.	Those	in	the public	sector	have	a	duty	to	those	in	the	private	sector	not	to	take	out	so	much	in pay	that	they	cause	others	unemployment.	That	is	why	we	point	out	that	every time	high	wage	settlements	in	nationalized	monopolies	lead	to	higher	charges	for telephones,	electricity,	coal	and	water,	they	can	drive	companies	out	of	business and	cost	other	people	their	jobs.

If	spending	money	like	water	was	the	answer	to	our	country's	problems,	we would	have	no	problems	now.

If	ever	a	nation	has	spent,	spent,	spent	and	spent	again,	ours	has.	Today	that dream	is	over.	All	of	that	money	has	got	us	nowhere	but	it	still	has	to	come	from somewhere.

Those	who	urge	us	to	relax	the	squeeze,	to	spend	yet	more	money indiscriminately	in	the	belief	that	it	will	help	the	unemployed	and	the	small businessman,	are	not	being	kind	or	compassionate	or	caring.	They	are	not	the friends	of	the	unemployed	or	the	small	business.	They	are	asking	us	to	do	again the	very	thing	that	caused	the	problems	in	the	first	place.	We	have	made	this point	repeatedly.

I	am	accused	of	lecturing	or	preaching	about	this.	I	suppose	it	is	a	critic's	way	of saying,	'Well,	we	know	it	is	true,	but	we	have	to	carp	at	something.'	I	do	not care	about	that.	But	I	do	care	about	the	future	of	free	enterprise,	the	jobs	and exports	it	provides	and	the	independence	it	brings	to	our	people.	Independence? Yes,	but	let	us	be	clear	what	we	mean	by	that.	Independence	does	not	mean contracting	out	of	all	relationships	with	others.	A	nation	can	be	free	but	it	will not	stay	free	for	long	if	it	has	no	friends	and	no	alliances.	Above	all,	it	will	not stay	free	if	it	cannot	pay	its	own	way	in	the	world.	By	the	same	token,	an individual	needs	to	be	part	of	a	community	and	to	feel	that	he	is	part	of	it.	There is	more	to	this	than	the	chance	to	earn	a	living	for	himself	and	his	family, essential	though	that	is.

Of	course,	our	vision	and	our	aims	go	far	beyond	the	complex	arguments	of economics,	but	unless	we	get	the	economy	right	we	shall	deny	our	people	the opportunity	to	share	that	vision	and	to	see	beyond	the	narrow	horizons	of economic	necessity.

Without	a	healthy	economy	we	cannot	have	a	healthy	society.	Without	a	healthy society	the	economy	will	not	stay	healthy	for	long.

But	it	is	not	the	state	that	creates	a	healthy	society.	When	the	state	grows	too powerful,	people	feel	that	they	count	for	less	and	less.

## The	state	drains	society,	not	only	of	its	wealth	but	of initiative,	of	energy,	the	will	to	improve	and	innovate	as well	as	to	preserve	what	is	best.

Our	aim	is	to	let	people	feel	that	they	count	for	more	and	more.	If	we	cannot trust	the	deepest	instincts	of	our	people	we	should	not	be	in	politics	at	all.	Some aspects	of	our	present	society	really	do	offend	those	instincts.

Decent	people	do	want	to	do	a	proper	job	at	work,	not	to	be	restrained	or intimidated	from	giving	value	for	money.	They	believe	that	honesty	should	be respected,	not	derided.	They	see	crime	and	violence	as	a	threat,	not	just	to society	but	to	their	own	orderly	way	of	life.	They	want	to	be	allowed	to	bring	up their	children	in	these	beliefs,	without	the	fear	that	their	efforts	will	be	daily frustrated	in	the	name	of	progress	or	free	expression.	Indeed,	that	is	what	family life	is	all	about.

There	is	not	a	generation	gap	in	a	happy	and	united	family.

People	yearn	to	be	able	to	rely	on	some	generally	accepted	standards.	Without them	you	have	not	got	a	society	at	all,	you	have	purposeless	anarchy.	A	healthy society	is	not	created	by	its	institutions,	either.	Great	schools	and	universities	do not	make	a	great	nation,	any	more	than	great	armies	do.	Only	a	great	nation	can create	and	involve	great	institutions	-	of	learning,	of	healing,	of	scientific advance.	And	a	great	nation	is	the	voluntary	creation	of	its	people	-	a	people composed	of	men	and	women	whose	pride	in	themselves	is	founded	on	the knowledge	of	what	they	can	give	to	a	community	of	which	they	in	turn	can	be

## proud.

If	our	people	feel	that	they	are	part	of	a	great	nation	and	they	are	prepared	to	will the	means	to	keep	it	great,	a	great	nation	we	shall	be,	and	shall	remain.	So,	what can	stop	us	from	achieving	this?	What	then	stands	in	our	way?	The	prospect	of another	winter	of	discontent? 2 	I	suppose	it	might.

But	I	prefer	to	believe	that	certain	lessons	have	been	learnt	from	experience,	that we	are	coming,	slowly,	painfully,	to	an	autumn	of	understanding.	And	I	hope that	it	will	be	followed	by	a	winter	of	common	sense.	If	it	is	not,	we	shall	not	be diverted	from	our	course.

To	those	waiting	with	bated	breath	for	that	favourite	media	catchphrase,	the	'Uturn',	I	have	only	one	thing	to	say.	'You	turn	if	you	want	to.	The	lady's	not	for turning.' 3

## Ronald	Reagan

## American	politician

A	successful	Hollywood	actor,	Ronald	Wilson	Reagan	(1911-2004)	became interested	in	politics	when	serving	as	president	of	the	Screen	Actors'	Guild (1947-52)	and	moved	increasingly	towards	Republicanism,	particularly following	his	marriage	in	1952	to	the	affluent	actress	Nancy	Davis	(1921-2016). He	joined	the	Republican	Party	in	1962	and	in	1966	was	elected	governor	of California,	a	post	he	held	until	1972.	In	1980,	after	two	previous	attempts,	he captured	the	party's	presidential	nomination	and	convincingly	defeated	President Jimmy	Carter	(1924-).	He	survived	an	attempted	assassination	in	1981	and secured	re-election	by	a	record	margin	in	1984.	His	programme	of	tax	cuts	and deficit	financing	brought	about	rapid	economic	upturn	between	1983	and	1986, while	on	the	international	stage	he	became	a	convert	to	détente,	holding	four summit	meetings	with	Soviet	leader	Mikhail	Gorbachev	and	signing	a	treaty	for the	scrapping	of	intermediate	nuclear	forces.	Dubbed	'the	great	communicator' for	his	accomplished	handling	of	the	media,	Reagan	had	a	unique,	populist rapport	with	'mainstream	America'	and	left	office	an	immensely	popular	figure.
