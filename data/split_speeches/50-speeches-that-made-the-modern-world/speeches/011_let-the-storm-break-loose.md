## 'Let	the	storm	break	loose'

18	February	1943,	Berlin,	Germany

The	opening	stages	of	World	War	II	had	seen	Germany	triumphantly overrunning	much	of	northern	Europe.	By	November	1942,	Germany	had also	made	significant	progress	on	the	Eastern	Front,	driving	deep	into	the Soviet	Union.	But	Soviet	resistance	then	forced	German	withdrawal, isolating	the	German	Sixth	Army	at	Stalingrad.	By	the	end	of	January	1943, the	Sixth	Army	had	surrendered,	while	German	forces	in	North	Africa	had retreated	from	the	Allies.	The	tide	of	the	war	had	turned.

As	Hitler's	chief	propagandist,	Goebbels	knew	it	was	vital	that	the	German people	did	not	weaken	at	the	news	of	these	reverses.	On	18	February	1943, in	front	of	film	cameras	and	radio	microphones,	he	addressed	a	specially selected	audience	of	thousands,	a	cross-section	of	German	society	which included	veterans	of	the	Eastern	Front.	In	the	hour-long	speech,	of	which	this an	edited	section,	Goebbels	skilfully	manipulated	his	audience	to	give enthusiastic	vocal	support	to	the	concept	of	total	war	-	the	complete mobilization	of	the	country's	material	and	human	resources.	He	employed the	technique	of	posing	dramatic	questions	to	the	audience,	well	aware	that their	responses	would	be	broadcast	to	the	world.

Goebbels	said	afterwards	of	his	listeners,	'They	applauded	at	just	the	right moments:	it	was	the	politically	best-trained	audience	you	can	find	in

Germany.'	Hitler's	chief	architect,	Albert	Speer,	commented	that,	while Goebbels'	delivery	of	the	speech	appeared	highly	emotional,	it	had	been	a calculated	act.	This	translation	is	by	Randall	Bytwerk.

You,	my	hearers,	at	this	moment	represent	the	whole	nation.	I	wish	to	ask you	ten	questions	that	you	will	answer	for	the	German	people	throughout	the world	-	but	especially	for	our	enemies,	who	are	listening	to	us	on	the	radio.

[The	crowd	is	at	the	peak	of	excitement.	Each	individual	feels	as	if	he	is	being spoken	to	personally.	With	full	participation	and	enthusiasm,	the	crowd	answers each	question.]

The	English	maintain	that	the	German	people	has	lost	faith	in	victory.

I	ask	you:	Do	you	believe	with	the	Führer	and	us	in	the	final	total	victory	of	the German	people?	I	ask	you:	Are	you	resolved	to	follow	the	Führer	through	thick and	thin	to	victory,	and	are	you	willing	to	accept	the	heaviest	personal	burdens in	the	fight	for	victory?

Second:	the	English	say	that	the	German	people	are	tired	of	fighting.	I	ask	you: Are	you	ready	to	follow	the	Führer	as	the	phalanx	of	the	homeland,	standing behind	the	fighting	army,	and	to	wage	war	with	wild	determination	through	all the	turns	of	fate	until	victory	is	ours?

Third:	the	English	maintain	that	the	German	people	have	no	desire	any	longer	to accept	the	government's	growing	demands	for	war	work.	I	ask	you:	Are	you	and the	German	people	willing	to	work,	if	the	Führer	orders,	ten,	twelve	and	if necessary	fourteen	hours	a	day	and	to	give	everything	for	victory?

Fourth:	the	English	maintain	that	the	German	people	are	resisting	the government's	total	war	measures.	They	do	not	want	total	war,	but	capitulation!

[Shouts:	'Never!	Never!	Never!']

I	ask	you:	Do	you	want	total	war?

If	necessary,

…do	you	want	a	war	more	total	and	radical	than anything	that	we	can	even	imagine	today?

Fifth:	the	English	maintain	that	the	German	people	have	lost	faith	in	the	Führer. I	ask	you:	is	your	confidence	in	the	Führer	greater,	more	faithful	and	unshakable than	ever	before?	Are	you	absolutely	and	completely	ready	to	follow	him wherever	he	goes	and	do	all	that	is	necessary	to	bring	the	war	to	a	victorious end?

[Thousands	of	voices	join	in	shouting:	'Führer,	command,	we	follow!'	A	wave	of shouts	of	'Heil!'	flows	through	the	hall.]

Sixth,	I	ask	you:	are	you	ready	from	now	on	to	give	your	full	strength	to	provide the	Eastern	Front	with	the	men	and	munitions	it	needs	to	give	Bolshevism	the death	blow?

Seventh,	I	ask	you:	do	you	take	a	holy	oath	to	the	front	that	the	homeland	stands firm	behind	them,	and	that	you	will	give	them	everything	they	need	to	win	the victory?

Eighth,	I	ask	you:	do	you,	especially	you	women,	want	the	government	to	do	all it	can	to	encourage	German	women	to	put	their	full	strength	at	work	to	support the	war	effort,	and	to	release	men	for	the	front	whenever	possible,	thereby helping	the	men	at	the	front?

Ninth,	I	ask	you:	do	you	approve,	if	necessary,	the	most	radical	measures	against a	small	group	of	shirkers	and	black-marketeers	who	pretend	there	is	peace	in	the middle	of	war	and	use	the	need	of	the	nation	for	their	own	selfish	purposes?	Do you	agree	that	those	who	harm	the	war	effort	should	lose	their	heads?

Tenth	and	lastly,	I	ask	you:	do	you	agree	that	above	all	in	war,	according	to	the National	Socialist	Party	platform,	the	same	rights	and	duties	should	apply	to	all, that	the	homeland	should	bear	the	heavy	burdens	of	the	war	together,	and	that the	burdens	should	be	shared	equally	between	high	and	low	and	rich	and	poor?

I	have	asked:	you	have	given	me	your	answers.	You	are	part	of	the	people,	and your	answers	are	those	of	the	German	people.	You	have	told	our	enemies	what they	needed	to	hear	so	that	they	will	have	no	false	illusions	or	ideas.

Now,	just	as	in	the	first	hours	of	our	rule	and	through	the	ten	years	that	followed, we	are	bound	firmly	in	brotherhood	with	the	German	people.	The	most	powerful ally	on	earth,	the	people	themselves,	stand	behind	us	and	are	determined	to follow	the	Führer,	come	what	may.	They	will	accept	the	heaviest	burdens	to	gain victory.	What	power	on	earth	can	hinder	us	from	reaching	our	goal?	Now	we must	and	will	succeed!

I	stand	before	you	not	only	as	the	spokesman	of	the	government,	but	as	the spokesman	of	the	people…We	are	all	children	of	our	people,	forged	together	by this	critical	hour	of	our	national	history.	We	promise	you,	we	promise	the	front, we	promise	the	Führer,	that	we	will	mould	together	the	homeland	into	a	force	on which	the	Führer	and	his	fighting	soldiers	can	rely	on	absolutely	and	blindly.	We pledge	to	do	all	in	our	life	and	work	that	is	necessary	for	victory…With	burning hearts	and	cool	heads	we	will	overcome	the	major	problems	of	this	phase	of	the war.	We	are	on	the	way	to	eventual	victory.	That	victory	rests	on	our	faith	in	the Führer.

This	evening	I	once	again	remind	the	whole	nation	of	its	duty.	The	Führer expects	us	to	do	that	which	will	throw	all	we	have	done	in	the	past	into	the shadows.	We	do	not	want	to	fail	him.	As	we	are	proud	of	him,	he	should	be proud	of	us.

The	great	crises	and	upsets	of	national	life	show	who	the	true	men	and	women are.	We	have	no	right	any	longer	to	speak	of	the	weaker	sex,	for	both	sexes	are displaying	the	same	determination	and	spiritual	strength.	The	nation	is	ready	for anything.	The	Führer	has	commanded,	and	we	will	follow	him.	In	this	hour	of national	reflection	and	contemplation,	we	believe	firmly	and	unshakably	in victory.	We	see	it	before	us,	we	need	only	reach	for	it.	We	must	resolve	to subordinate	everything	to	it.	That	is	the	duty	of	the	hour.	Let	the	slogan	be: 'Now,	people	rise	up	and	let	the	storm	break	loose!'

[Goebbels'	final	words	were	lost	in	a	storm	of	applause.]

## Heinrich	Himmler

German	politician	and	chief	of	police

Heinrich	Luitpold	Himmler	(1900-45)	joined	the	Nazi	Party	in	1925,	and	in 1929	Adolf	Hitler	made	him	head	of	the	SS	(Schutzstaffel,	'protection squadron'),	which	he	developed	from	Hitler's	personal	bodyguard	into	a powerful	party	weapon.	Inside	Germany	and	later	in	Nazi-occupied	countries,	he developed	the	Gestapo	(Geheime	Staatspolizei,	'secret	state	police')	and	used this	ruthless	organization	to	unleash	an	unmatched	political	and	anti-Semitic terror	of	espionage,	wholesale	detention,	mass	deportation,	torture,	execution and	massacre.	In	July	1944,	he	was	made	commander-in-chief	of	the	home forces	and	in	April	1945	proposed	an	unconditional	surrender	to	the	Allies. Hitler	immediately	stripped	him	of	power	and	issued	orders	for	his	arrest. Himmler	disappeared	but	was	captured	by	the	British	near	Bremen.	He committed	suicide	by	swallowing	a	cyanide	phial	concealed	in	his	mouth	and thereby	escaped	trial	for	his	central	role	in	the	murder	of	over	seven	million people.
