## 'Why	do	we	want	to	offer	this	non-cooperation?'

12	August	1920,	Madras	(now	Chennai),	India

Gandhi	made	this	speech	near	the	very	beginning	of	his	long	struggle. Following	violent	campaigns	for	Indian	independence,	the	Anarchical	and Revolutionary	Crimes	Act	of	1919,	popularly	known	as	the	Rowlatt	Act, made	permanent	the	suspension	of	civil	liberties	enacted	during	World	War I.	These	developments	prompted	Gandhi	to	organize	a	peaceful,	principled resistance	movement	known	as satyagraha ('firmness	in	truth').	However, this	was	accompanied	by	violence	in	places,	leading	to	the	imposition	of martial	law	in	the	Punjab,	and	the	Amritsar	Massacre	of	April	1919,	at	which British	troops	fired	into	a	crowd	gathered	for	a	religious	festival,	killing	at least	379.

The	peace	terms	presented	to	Turkey	by	the	Allies	following	World	War	I	in the	Treaty	of	Sèvres	angered	Indian	Muslims,	who	launched	the	Khilafat movement	in	September	1919	to	protect	the	Turkish	Khilafa	and	save	the Ottoman	Empire	from	dismemberment	by	Britain	and	her	allies.	Gandhi supported	this	movement,	and	in	June	1920	he	wrote	to	the	viceroy announcing	his	intention	to	start	a	non-cooperation	movement	in	protest against	the	treaty.	In	his	letter,	he	referred	to	the	right	of	the	subject	'to refuse	to	assist	a	ruler	who	misrules'.	Supporters	of	the	non-cooperation movement	were	instructed	to	refuse	to	perform	government	duties,	withdraw their	children	from	schools	and	colleges	and	establish	national	schools	and colleges.	They	were	to	boycott	British	courts	and	establish	private	courts. They	were	to	advocate	truth	and	non-violence	at	all	times	and	wear	Indian home-spun	cloth.

Gandhi	formally	launched	his	non-cooperation	movement	on	1	August	1920. Soon	afterwards,	he	spoke	to	a	crowd	of	50,000	gathered	on	the	beach	at Madras.	In	the	speech	he	explains	the	importance	of	the	Khilafat	movement and	the	principles	of	the	non-violence	movement.

## Mr	Chairman	and	friends…

I	have	sat	here	to	address	you	on	a	most	important	question…I	have	come	to	ask every	one	of	you	whether	you	are	ready	and	willing	to	give	sufficiently	for	your country's	sake,	for	you	country's	honour	and	religion…

What	is	this	non-cooperation,	about	which	you	have	heard	much,	and	why	do	we want	to	offer	this	non-cooperation?	I	wish	to	go	for	the	time	being	into	the	way. There	are	two	things	before	this	country:	the	first	and	the	foremost	is	the Khilafat	question.	On	this	the	heart	of	the	Mussulmans 1 	of	India	has	become lacerated.	British	pledges	given	after	the	greatest	deliberation	by	the	prime minister	of	England 2 	in	the	name	of	the	English	nation,	have	been	dragged	into the	mire.	The	promises	given	to	Muslim	India…have	been	broken,	and	the	great religion	of	Islam	has	been	placed	in	danger.

The	Mussulmans	hold	-	and	I	venture	to	think	they	rightly	hold	-	that,	so	long	as British	promises	remain	unfulfilled,	so	long	is	it	impossible	for	them	to	tender whole-hearted	fealty	and	loyalty	to	the	British	connection;	and	if	it	is	to	be	a choice	for	a	devout	Mussulman	between	loyalty	to	the	British	connection	and loyalty	to	his	Code	and	Prophet,	he	will	not	require	a	second	to	make	his	choice -	and	he	has	declared	his	choice.	The	Mussulmans	say	frankly,	openly,	and honourably	to	the	whole	world	that	if	the	British	ministers	and	the	British	nation do	not	fulfil	the	pledges	given	to	them…it	will	be	impossible	for	them	to	retain Islamic	loyalty.

It	is	a	question,	then,	for	the	rest	of	the	Indian	population	to	consider	whether they	want	to	perform	a	neighbourly	duty	by	their	Mussulman	countrymen,	and	if they	do,	they	have	an	opportunity	of	a	lifetime,	which	will	not	occur	for	another 100	years,	to	show	their	goodwill,	fellowship	and	friendship	and	to	prove	what they	have	been	saying	for	all	these	long	years,	that	the	Mussulman	is	the	brother of	the	Hindu.	If	the	Hindu	regards	that	before	the	connection	with	the	British nation	comes	his	natural	connection	with	his	Muslim	brother,	then	I	say	to	you that	if	you	find	that	the	Muslim	claim	is	just…you	cannot	do	otherwise	than	help the	Mussulman	through	and	through…

These	are	the	plain	conditions	which	the	Indian	Mussulmans	have	accepted;	and it	was	when	they	saw	that	they	could	accept	the	proffered	aid	of	the	Hindus,	that they	could	always	justify	the	cause	and	the	means	before	the	whole	world,	that they	decided	to	accept	the	proffered	hand	of	fellowship.

It	is	then	for	the	Hindus	and	Mohammedans 3 	to	offer	a	united	front	to	the	whole of	the	Christian	powers	of	Europe	and	tell	them	that	weak	as	India	is,	India	has still	got	the	capacity	for	preserving	her	self-respect…

That	is	the	Khilafat	in	a	nut-shell;	but	you	have	also	got	the	Punjab.	The	Punjab has	wounded	the	heart	of	India	as	no	other	question	has	for	the	past	century.	I	do not	exclude	from	my	calculation	the	Mutiny	of	1857.	Whatever	hardships	India had	to	suffer	during	the	Mutiny,	the	insult	that	was	attempted	to	be	offered	to	her during	the	passage	of	the	Rowlatt	legislation	and	that	which	was	offered	after	its passage	were	unparalleled	in	Indian	history…The	House	of	Commons,	the House	of	Lords,	Mr	Montagu, 4 	the	Viceroy	of	India, 5 	every	one	of	them	knows what	the	feeling	of	India	is	on	this	Khilafat	question	and	on	that	of	the	Punjab… [but]	they	are	not	willing	to	give	the	justice	which	is	India's	due	and	which	she demands.

I	suggest	that…unless	we	have	gained	a	measure	of	self-respect	at	the	hands	of the	British	rulers	in	India,	no	connection	and	no	friendly	intercourse	is	possible between	them	and	ourselves.	I	therefore	venture	to	suggest	this	beautiful	and unanswerable	method	of	non-cooperation.

I	have	been	told	that	non-cooperation	is	unconstitutional.	I	venture	to	deny	that	it is	unconstitutional.	On	the	contrary,

## I	hold	that	non-cooperation	is	a	just	and	religious doctrine;	it	is	the	inherent	right	of	every	human	being…

and	it	is	perfectly	constitutional…I	do	not	claim	any	constitutionality	for	a rebellion,	successful	or	otherwise,	so	long	as	that	rebellion	means	in	the	ordinary sense	of	the	term,	what	it	does	mean	-	namely	wresting	justice	by	violent	means. On	the	contrary,	I	have	said	it	repeatedly	to	my	countrymen	that	violence, whatever	end	it	may	serve	in	Europe,	will	never	serve	us	in	India.

My	brother	and	friend	Shaukat	Ali 6 	believes	in	methods	of	violence…but because	he	recognizes	as	a	true	soldier	that	means	of	violence	are	not	open	to India,	he	sides	with	me,	accepting	my	humble	assistance,	and	pledges	his	word that	so	long	as	I	am	with	him	and	so	long	as	he	believes	in	the	doctrine,	so	long will	he	not	harbour	even	the	idea	of	violence	against	any	single	Englishman	or any	single	man	on	earth…

As	soon	as	India	accepts	the	doctrine	of	the	sword,	my	life	as	an	Indian	is finished.	It	is	because	I	believe	in	a	mission	special	to	India	and	it	is	because	I believe	that	the	ancients	of	India,	after	centuries	of	experience,	have	found	out that	the	true	thing	for	any	human	being	on	earth	is	not	justice	based	on	violence, but	justice	based	on	sacrifice	of	self,	justice	based	on	Yagna	and	Kurbani. 7 	I cling	to	that	doctrine	and	I	shall	cling	to	it	for	ever.	It	is	for	that	reason	I	tell	you that	whilst	my	friend	believes	also	in	the	doctrine	of	violence	and	has	adopted the	doctrine	of	non-violence	as	a	weapon	of	the	weak,	I	believe	in	the	doctrine	of non-violence	as	a	weapon	of	the	strongest…

I	say	to	my	countrymen:	so	long	as	you	have	a	sense	of	honour	and	so	long	as you	wish	to	remain	the	descendants	and	defenders	of	the	noble	traditions	that have	been	handed	to	you	for	generations	after	generations,	it	is	unconstitutional for	you	not	to	non-cooperate	and	unconstitutional	for	you	to	co-operate	with	a government	which	has	become	so	unjust	as	our	government	has	become.

I	am	not	anti-English;	I	am	not	anti-British;	I	am	not	anti	any	government;	but	I am	anti-untruth	-	anti-humbug	and	anti-injustice…

I	had	hoped,	at	the	Congress	at	Amritsar 8 	-	I	am	speaking	God's	truth	before	you -	when	I	pleaded	on	bended	knees	before	some	of	you	for	co-operation	with	the government.	I	had	full	hope	that	the	British	ministers	-	who	are	wise,	as	a	rule	would	placate	the	Mussulman	sentiment;	that	they	would	do	full	justice	in	the matter	of	the	Punjab	atrocities.	And	therefore	I	said:	Let	us	return	goodwill	to the	hand	of	fellowship	that	has	been	extended	to	us,	which	I	then	believed	was extended	to	us	through	the	Royal	Proclamation.	It	was	on	that	account	that	I pleaded	for	co-operation.

But	today,	that	faith	having	been	obliterated	by	the	acts	of	the	British	ministers,	I

am	here	to	plead	not	for	futile	obstruction	in	the	legislative	council,	but	for	real, substantial	non-cooperation,	which	would	paralyse	the	mightiest	government	on earth.

That	is	what	I	stand	for	today.	Until	we	have	wrung	justice,	and	until	we	have wrung	our	self-respect	from	unwilling	hands	and	from	unwilling	pens	there	can be	no	cooperation…

I	deny	being	a	visionary.	I	do	not	accept	the	claim	of	saintliness.	I	am	of	the earth,	earthy,	a	common	man	as	much	as	any	one	of	you,	probably	much	more than	you	are.	I	am	prone	to	as	many	weaknesses	as	you	are…

I	have	understood	the	secret	of	my	own	sacred	Hinduism,	I	have	learnt	the lesson	that	non-cooperation	is	the	duty	not	merely	of	the	saint,	but	it	is	the	duty of	every	ordinary	citizen	who	-	not	knowing	much,	not	caring	to	know	much	wants	to	perform	his	ordinary	household	functions…

## I	am	asking	my	countrymen	in	India	to	follow	no	other gospel	than	the	gospel	of	self-sacrifice	which	precedes every	battle.

Whether	you	belong	to	the	school	of	violence	or	non-violence,	you	will	still	have to	go	through	the	fire	of	sacrifice	and	of	discipline.	May	God	grant	you,	may God	grant	our	leaders,	the	wisdom,	the	courage	and	the	true	knowledge	to	lead the	nation	to	its	cherished	goal.	May	God	grant	the	people	of	India	the	right	path, the	true	vision	and	the	ability	and	the	courage	to	follow	this	path,	difficult	and yet	easy,	of	sacrifice.

back to your towns, to your lands, to your houses, distant but near to my heart, the vigorous impression of this meeting: the flame burning, because that which has not been may because if victory was maimed once, it does not follow that it can be maimed a second 'Carry Keep be,

Benito Mussolini

## 4 Benito	Mussolini

## Italian	dictator

In	1919,	Benito	Amilcare	Andrea	Mussolini	(1883-1945)	founded	the	fascist movement,	exploiting	the	widespread	disillusionment	felt	by	many	Italians	in	the wake	of	World	War	II	to	promote	an	extreme	nationalism.	In	1922,	Mussolini was	invited	by	the	Italian	king,	Victor	Emmanuel	III,	to	form	a	government	and by	1929,	through	intimidation,	patronage	and	propaganda,	he	had	turned	Italy into	a	totalitarian	state.	Ambitious	to	build	an	overseas	empire,	through	the 1930s	Mussolini	increasingly	allied	his	country	with	Nazi	Germany	and eventually	led	Italy	to	war	against	the	Allies	in	1939.	Following	the	Allied landings	in	Sicily	(1943),	both	the	king	and	his	own	Fascist	Council	turned	on him	and	in	1945	he	was	summarily	executed	while	attempting	to	flee	the country.
