## 'The	only	thing	we	have	to	fear	is	fear	itself'

4	March	1933,	Washington,	DC,	USA

Franklin	D	Roosevelt's	first	inaugural	address,	delivered	in	the	depths	of	the Great	Depression,	brought	a	much-needed	message	of	hope.	With	over	half the	American	workforce	unemployed,	farm	prices	at	rock	bottom	and industry	in	disarray,	the	country	was	in	despair.	On	accepting	the	nomination as	Democratic	candidate	for	the	1932	election,	Roosevelt	had	promised	a 'New	Deal	for	the	American	people'.	Now	he	was	able	to	begin implementing	policies	that	were	little	short	of	revolutionary	in	a	country deeply	mistrustful	of	socialism.

Roosevelt	had	been	remarkably	vague	during	the	election	campaign	about how	he	planned	to	tackle	the	huge	economic	problems	facing	the	nation. Now	he	set	out	his	vision	clearly	and	confidently,	speaking	both	to	the	crowd gathered	at	the	White	House	and	to	the	country	at	large	via	radio	broadcast, which	was	to	become	his	favourite	medium.

His	tone	is	solemn,	but	displays	the	forthright	style	that	was	his	trademark. All	the	major	tenets	of	the	New	Deal	are	here,	presented	almost	as	a covenant	between	the	government	and	the	people.	The	speech	is	one	of extraordinary	optimism,	portraying	a	bright	future	and	evoking	the	stillpotent	national	mythology	of	the	pioneer	spirit,	without	ever	underestimating the	impact	of	the	Depression	on	ordinary	citizens.

The	immediate	result	was	the	so-called	'Hundred	Days',	in	which	an emergency	session	of	Congress	pushed	through	most	of	the	necessary reforming	legislation.

I	am	certain	that	my	fellow	Americans	expect	that,	on	my	induction	into	the presidency,	I	will	address	them	with	a	candour	and	a	decision	which	the	present situation	of	our	nation	impels.	This	is	pre-eminently	the	time	to	speak	the	truth, the	whole	truth,	frankly	and	boldly.	Nor	need	we	shrink	from	honestly	facing conditions	in	our	country	today.	This	great	nation	will	endure	as	it	has	endured, will	revive	and	will	prosper.

So,	first	of	all,	let	me	assert	my	firm	belief	that	the	only	thing	we	have	to	fear	is fear	itself	-	nameless,	unreasoning,	unjustified	terror	which	paralyses	needed efforts	to	convert	retreat	into	advance.	In	every	dark	hour	of	our	national	life,	a leadership	of	frankness	and	vigour	has	met	with	that	understanding	and	support of	the	people	themselves	which	is	essential	to	victory.	I	am	convinced	that	you will	again	give	that	support	to	leadership	in	these	critical	days.

In	such	a	spirit,	on	my	part	and	on	yours,	we	face	our	common	difficulties.	They concern,	thank	God,	only	material	things.	Values	have	shrunken	to	fantastic levels;	taxes	have	risen;	our	ability	to	pay	has	fallen;	government	of	all	kinds	is faced	by	serious	curtailment	of	income;	the	means	of	exchange	are	frozen	in	the currents	of	trade;	the	withered	leaves	of	industrial	enterprise	lie	on	every	side; farmers	find	no	markets	for	their	produce;	the	savings	of	many	years	in thousands	of	families	are	gone.

More	important,	a	host	of	unemployed	citizens	face	the	grim	problem	of existence	and	an	equally	great	number	toil	with	little	return.	Only	a	foolish optimist	can	deny	the	dark	realities	of	the	moment.

Yet	our	distress	comes	from	no	failure	of	substance.

We	are	stricken	by	no	plague	of	locusts.	Compared	with	the	perils	which	our forefathers	conquered	because	they	believed	and	were	not	afraid,	we	have	still much	to	be	thankful	for.	Nature	still	offers	her	bounty	and	human	efforts	have multiplied	it.	Plenty	is	at	our	doorstep,	but	a	generous	use	of	it	languishes	in	the very	sight	of	the	supply.	Primarily,	this	is	because	rulers	of	the	exchange	of mankind's	goods	have	failed	through	their	own	stubbornness	and	their	own incompetence,	have	admitted	their	failure	and	have	abdicated.	Practices	of	the unscrupulous	money-changers	stand	indicted	in	the	court	of	public	opinion, rejected	by	the	hearts	and	minds	of	men.

True	they	have	tried,	but	their	efforts	have	been	cast	in	the	pattern	of	an	outworn tradition.	Faced	by	failure	of	credit,	they	have	proposed	only	the	lending	of	more money.	Stripped	of	the	lure	of	profit	by	which	to	induce	our	people	to	follow their	false	leadership,	they	have	resorted	to	exhortations,	pleading	tearfully	for restored	confidence.	They	know	only	the	rules	of	a	generation	of	self-seekers. They	have	no	vision,	and	when	there	is	no	vision	the	people	perish.

The	money-changers	have	fled	from	their	high	seats	in	the	temple	of	our civilization. 	We	may	now	restore	that	temple	to	the	ancient	truths.	The	measure 1 of	the	restoration	lies	in	the	extent	to	which	we	apply	social	values	more	noble than	mere	monetary	profit.

Happiness	lies	not	in	the	mere	possession	of	money;	it	lies	in	the	joy	of achievement,	in	the	thrill	of	creative	effort.	The	joy	and	moral	stimulation	of work	no	longer	must	be	forgotten	in	the	mad	chase	of	evanescent	profits.

These	dark	days	will	be	worth	all	they	cost	us	if	they	teach	us	that	our	true destiny	is	not	to	be	ministered	unto	but	to	minister	to	ourselves	and	to	our	fellow men.

Recognition	of	the	falsity	of	material	wealth	as	the standard	of	success	goes	hand	in	hand	with	the abandonment	of	the	false	belief	that	public	office	and high	political	position	are	to	be	valued	only	by	the standards	of	pride	of	place	and	personal	profit…

and	there	must	be	an	end	to	a	conduct	in	banking	and	in	business	which	too	often has	given	to	a	sacred	trust	the	likeness	of	callous	and	selfish	wrongdoing.	Small wonder	that	confidence	languishes,	for	it	thrives	only	on	honesty,	on	honour,	on the	sacredness	of	obligations,	on	faithful	protection,	on	unselfish	performance; without	them	it	cannot	live.	Restoration	calls,	however,	not	for	changes	in	ethics alone.	This	nation	asks	for	action,	and	action	now.

Our	greatest	primary	task	is	to	put	people	to	work.	This	is	no	unsolvable problem	if	we	face	it	wisely	and	courageously.	It	can	be	accomplished	in	part	by direct	recruiting	by	the	government	itself,	treating	the	task	as	we	would	treat	the emergency	of	a	war,	but	at	the	same	time,	through	this	employment, accomplishing	greatly	needed	projects	to	stimulate	and	reorganize	the	use	of	our natural	resources.

Hand	in	hand	with	this,	we	must	frankly	recognize	the	overbalance	of	population in	our	industrial	centres	and	-	by	engaging	on	a	national	scale	in	a	redistribution -	endeavour	to	provide	a	better	use	of	the	land	for	those	best	fitted	for	the	land. The	task	can	be	helped	by	definite	efforts	to	raise	the	values	of	agricultural products	and	with	this	the	power	to	purchase	the	output	of	our	cities.	It	can	be helped	by	preventing	realistically	the	tragedy	of	the	growing	loss,	through foreclosure,	of	our	small	homes	and	our	farms.	It	can	be	helped	by	insistence that	the	federal,	state,	and	local	governments	act	forthwith	on	the	demand	that their	cost	be	drastically	reduced.	It	can	be	helped	by	the	unifying	of	relief activities	which	today	are	often	scattered,	uneconomical	and	unequal.	It	can	be helped	by	national	planning	for	and	supervision	of	all	forms	of	transportation and	of	communications	and	other	utilities	which	have	a	definitely	public character.	There	are	many	ways	in	which	it	can	be	helped,	but	it	can	never	be helped	merely	by	talking	about	it.	We	must	act	and	act	quickly.

Finally,	in	our	progress	toward	a	resumption	of	work	we	require	two	safeguards against	a	return	of	the	evils	of	the	old	order:	there	must	be	a	strict	supervision	of all	banking	and	credits	and	investments,	so	that	there	will	be	an	end	to speculation	with	other	people's	money;	and	there	must	be	provision	for	an adequate	but	sound	currency.

These	are	the	lines	of	attack.	I	shall	presently	urge	upon	a	new	Congress,	in special	session,	detailed	measures	for	their	fulfilment,	and	I	shall	seek	the immediate	assistance	of	the	several	states.

Through	this	programme	of	action,	we	address	ourselves	to	putting	our	own national	house	in	order	and	making	income	balance	outgo.

Our	international	trade	relations,	though	vastly	important,	are	in	point	of	time and	necessity	secondary	to	the	establishment	of	a	sound	national	economy.	I favour	as	a	practical	policy	the	putting	of	first	things	first.	I	shall	spare	no	effort to	restore	world	trade	by	international	economic	readjustment,	but	the emergency	at	home	cannot	wait	on	that	accomplishment.

The	basic	thought	that	guides	these	specific	means	of	national	recovery	is	not narrowly	nationalistic.	It	is	the	insistence,	as	a	first	consideration,	upon	the interdependence	of	the	various	elements	in	and	parts	of	the	United	States	-	a recognition	of	the	old	and	permanently	important	manifestation	of	the	American spirit	of	the	pioneer.	It	is	the	way	to	recovery.	It	is	the	immediate	way.	It	is	the strongest	assurance	that	the	recovery	will	endure.

In	the	field	of	world	policy	I	would	dedicate	this	nation	to	the	policy	of	the	good neighbour	-	the	neighbour	who	resolutely	respects	himself	and,	because	he	does so,	respects	the	rights	of	others;	the	neighbour	who	respects	his	obligations	and respects	the	sanctity	of	his	agreements	in	and	with	a	world	of	neighbours.

## If	I	read	the	temper	of	our	people	correctly,	we	now realize	as	we	have	never	realized	before	our interdependence	on	each	other;	that	we	cannot	merely take	but	we	must	give	as	well…

that	if	we	are	to	go	forward,	we	must	move	as	a	trained	and	loyal	army,	willing to	sacrifice	for	the	good	of	a	common	discipline,	because	without	such	discipline no	progress	is	made,	no	leadership	becomes	effective.	We	are,	I	know,	ready	and willing	to	submit	our	lives	and	property	to	such	discipline,	because	it	makes possible	a	leadership	which	aims	at	a	larger	good.	This	I	propose	to	offer, pledging	that	the	larger	purposes	will	bind	upon	us	all	as	a	sacred	obligation	with a	unity	of	duty	hitherto	evoked	only	in	time	of	armed	strife.

With	this	pledge	taken,	I	assume	unhesitatingly	the	leadership	of	this	great	army of	our	people,	dedicated	to	a	disciplined	attack	upon	our	common	problems.

Action	in	this	image	and	to	this	end	is	feasible	under	the	form	of	government which	we	have	inherited	from	our	ancestors.	Our	constitution	is	so	simple	and practical	that	it	is	possible	always	to	meet	extraordinary	needs	by	changes	in emphasis	and	arrangement	without	loss	of	essential	form.	That	is	why	our constitutional	system	has	proved	itself	the	most	superbly	enduring	political mechanism	the	modern	world	has	produced.	It	has	met	every	stress	of	vast expansion	of	territory,	of	foreign	wars,	of	bitter	internal	strife,	of	world	relations.

It	is	to	be	hoped	that	the	normal	balance	of	executive	and	legislative	authority may	be	wholly	adequate	to	meet	the	unprecedented	task	before	us.	But	it	may	be that	an	unprecedented	demand	and	need	for	undelayed	action	may	call	for temporary	departure	from	that	normal	balance	of	public	procedure.

I	am	prepared	under	my	constitutional	duty	to	recommend	the	measures	that	a stricken	nation	in	the	midst	of	a	stricken	world	may	require.	These	measures,	or such	other	measures	as	the	Congress	may	build	out	of	its	experience	and wisdom,	I	shall	seek,	within	my	constitutional	authority,	to	bring	to	speedy adoption.

But	in	the	event	that	the	Congress	shall	fail	to	take	one	of	these	two	courses,	and in	the	event	that	the	national	emergency	is	still	critical,	I	shall	not	evade	the	clear course	of	duty	that	will	then	confront	me.	I	shall	ask	the	Congress	for	the	one remaining	instrument	to	meet	the	crisis	-	broad	executive	power	to	wage	a	war against	the	emergency,	as	great	as	the	power	that	would	be	given	to	me	if	we were	in	fact	invaded	by	a	foreign	foe.

For	the	trust	reposed	in	me,	I	will	return	the	courage	and	the	devotion	that	befit the	time.	I	can	do	no	less.

We	face	the	arduous	days	that	lie	before	us	in	the	warm	courage	of	national unity;	with	the	clear	consciousness	of	seeking	old	and	precious	moral	values; with	the	clean	satisfaction	that	comes	from	the	stern	performance	of	duty	by	old and	young	alike.	We	aim	at	the	assurance	of	a	rounded	and	permanent	national life.

We	do	not	distrust	the	future	of	essential	democracy.

The	people	of	the	United	States	have	not	failed.	In	their need	they	have	registered	a	mandate	that	they	want direct,	vigorous	action.	They	have	asked	for	discipline and	direction	under	leadership.

They	have	made	me	the	present	instrument	of	their	wishes.	In	the	spirit	of	the gift	I	take	it.

In	this	dedication	of	a	nation	we	humbly	ask	the	blessing	of	God.	May	he	protect each	and	every	one	of	us.	May	he	guide	me	in	the	days	to	come.

## La	Pasionaria

## Spanish	journalist	and	politician

The	daughter	of	a	Basque	miner,	Isidora	Dolores	Gómez	Ibárruri,	known	as	La Pasionaria	(1895-1989),	was	one	of	the	founding	members	of	the	Spanish Communist	Party	in	1920.	During	the	Civil	War	(1936-9)	she	became	legendary for	her	passionate	exhortations	to	the	Spanish	people	to	fight	against	the	fascist forces,	declaring:	'It	is	better	to	die	on	your	feet	than	to	live	on	your	knees.'
