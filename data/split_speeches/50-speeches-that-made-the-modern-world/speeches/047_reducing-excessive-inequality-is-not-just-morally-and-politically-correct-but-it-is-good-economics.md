## 'Reducing	excessive	inequality	is	not	just	morally	and politically	correct,	but	it	is	good	economics'

17	June	2015,	Brussels,	Belgium

This	speech	was	given	to	the	Grandes	Conférences	Catholiques,	a	highprofile	lecture	series	which	has	run	since	1931.	In	its	own	words,	it	is 'animated	by	a	spirit	of	openness,	curiosity	and	free	thinking'.	As	head	of	the IMF,	Christine	Lagarde	would	naturally	be	expected	to	lecture	on economics.	Her	chosen	theme	was	economic	inequality:	its	causes,	its damaging	effects	and	how	it	can	be	addressed.

The	IMF	has	at	times	faced	criticism	for	favouring	the	interests	of	the developed	world	over	poorer	countries,	but	Lagarde's	focus	is	firmly	on global	concerns,	and	she	draws	numerous	examples	from	developing	nations.

However,	her	overriding	argument	is	that	the	most	pressing	problem	is internal	inequality:	within	rather	than	between	individual	nations.

Lagarde	is	a	highly	polished	and	engaging	speaker,	who	can	convey	complex ideas	with	a	persuasive	lightness	of	touch.	Here,	she	draws	on	a	cynical	joke about	the	luxury	yachts	owned	by	Wall	Street	bankers	for	her	central metaphor	of	'small	boats',	which	she	defines	as	'the	livelihoods	and economic	aspirations	of	the	poor	and	the	middle	class'.

Good	evening!	I	am	absolutely	delighted	to	participate	again	in	this prestigious	conference,	and	I	would	like	to	thank	Vice	Premier	Reynders 1 	for	his kind	introduction.

Last	month,	on	May	6,	I	almost	choked	on	my	morning	yoghurt	when	I	saw	the front	page	of	a	leading	business	newspaper.	There	it	was	-	a	league	table	of	the world's	best	paid	hedge	fund	managers. 2 	It	showed	that	the	highest	earner	was able	to	pocket	$1.3	billion	in	2014.	One	man,	$1.3	billion!

Together,	the	25	best-paid	hedge	fund	managers	earned	a	combined	$12	billion last	year,	even	as	their	industry	suffered	from	largely	mediocre	investment performance.

This	reminded	me	of	a	famous	Wall	Street	joke	-	about	a	visitor	to	New	York who	admired	the	gorgeous	yachts	of	the	richest	bankers	and	brokers.	After gazing	long	and	thoughtfully	at	these	beautiful	boats,	the	visitor	asked	wryly: 'Where	are	the	customers'	yachts?'	Of	course,	the	customers	could	not	afford yachts,	even	though	they	dutifully	followed	the	advice	of	their	bankers	and brokers.

Why	is	this	relevant	right	now?	Because	the	theme	of	growing	and	excessive inequality	is	not	only	back	in	the	headlines,	it	has	also	become	a	problem	for economic	growth	and	development.	I	would	like	to	take	an	economic	perspective on	this	with	you	tonight.	I	will	not	focus	on	the	gorgeous	yachts	of	the	superrich,	who	have	become	the	face	of	a	new	Gilded	Age.	It	is	not	immoral	to	enjoy one's	financial	success.

But	I	would	like	to	bring	into	the	discussion	what	I	would	call	the	'small	boats'	the	livelihoods	and	economic	aspirations	of	the	poor	and	the	middle	class.

In	too	many	countries,	economic	growth	has	failed	to

## lift	these	small	boats	-	while	the	gorgeous	yachts	have been	riding	the	waves	and	enjoying	the	wind	in	their sails.

In	too	many	cases,	poor	and	middle-class	households	have	come	to	realise	that hard	work	and	determination	alone	may	not	be	enough	to	keep	them	afloat…

My	key	message	tonight	is	this:	reducing	excessive	inequality	-	by	lifting	the 'small	boats'	-	is	not	just	morally	and	politically	correct,	but	it	is	good economics.

You	do	not	have	to	be	an	altruist	to	support	policies	that	lift	the	incomes	of	the poor	and	the	middle	class.	Everybody	will	benefit	from	these	policies,	because they	are	essential	to	generate	higher,	more	inclusive	and	more	sustainable growth.

In	other	words,	if	you	want	to	see	more	durable	growth,	you	need	to	generate more	equitable	growth.	With	this	in	mind,	I	would	like	to	focus	on	three	issues:

- 1 The	global	economic	outlook.
- 2 The	causes	and	consequences	of	excessive	inequality.
- 3 The	policies	needed	for	stronger,	more	inclusive	and	more	sustainable growth.

Let	me	start	by	describing	the	global	economic	weather	map,	as	we	see	it. According	to	the	IMF's	spring	forecast,	the	global	economy	will	grow	3.5	per cent	this	year	-	about	the	same	as	last	year	-	and	3.8	per	cent	in	2016.

Advanced	economies	are	doing	slightly	better	than	last	year.	In	the	US,	the outlook	still	is	for	a	strong	expansion	-	the	weak	first	quarter	was	just	a temporary	setback.	Prospects	in	the	Euro	Area	are	improving,	partly	because	of monetary	easing	by	the	European	Central	Bank.	And	Japan	seems	to	finally	reap the	first	rewards	of	its	'three	arrows'	recovery	strategy	(monetary,	fiscal	and structural).

Forecasts	for	most	emerging	and	developing	economies	are	slightly	worse	than last	year,	mainly	because	commodity	exporters	are	affected	by	price	declines, especially	for	oil…But	there	is	a	tremendous	diversity	of	national	trends	-	from still	strong	growth	in	India	to	recession	in	Brazil	and	Russia.

So	the	good	news	remains	that	the	global	recovery	continues.	But	growth remains	moderate	overall	and	uneven	across	countries.

What	about	the	years	beyond	2016,	the	second	half	of	this	decade?	Well,	here	is where	I	have	to	share	some	not-so-good	news	with	you.	Our	view	at	the	IMF	is that	the	growth	potential	of	both	advanced	and	emerging	economies	is	likely	to be	lower	in	the	years	to	come.	This	is	partly	because	of	changing	demographics and	lower	productivity.	Our	concern	is	that	this	will	bring	more	challenges	in	the labour	markets,	less-solid	public	finances	and	slower	improvements	in	living standards.

This	is	the	'new	mediocre'	about	which	I	have	been	warning.	For	the	'small boats',	it	means	that	the	wind	is	picking	up,	but	it	is	not	strong	enough	to	reduce high	unemployment.	It	is	not	strong	enough	to	bolster	middle-class	incomes	and drive	poverty	reduction.	It	is	simply	not	strong	enough	to	lift	the	'small	boats'	even	as	the	yachts	are	enjoying	the	breeze	out	on	the	high	seas.

So,	what	is	going	on?	Are	we	to	resign	in	the	face	of	unfavourable	weather?	Is there	no	hope	for	the	captains	of	the	'small	boats'…?

The	short	answer	is:	there	is	hope,	but	to	see	it,	we	need	to	step	back	and	look	at the	global	picture	before	we	zoom	in	on	the	country	level.

Imagine	lining	up	the	world's	population	from	the	poorest	to	the	richest,	each standing	behind	a	pile	of	money	that	represents	his	or	her	annual	income.

You	will	see	that	the	world	is	a	very	unequal	place.	There	is	obviously	a	vast gulf	between	the	richest	and	the	poorest.	But	if	you	look	at	the	changes	in	this line-up	over	time,	you	will	notice	that	global	income	inequality	-	that	is, inequality	between	countries	-	has	actually	fallen	steadily	over	the	past	few decades.

Why?	Because	average	incomes	in	emerging	market	economies,	such	as	China and	India,	have	risen	much	faster	than	those	in	richer	countries.	This	shows	the transformative	power	of	international	trade	and	investment.	The	massive	global flows	of	products,	services,	people,	knowledge	and	ideas	have	been	good	for global	equality	of	income	-	and	we	need	more	of	that.	So	we	can	further	reduce the	gap	between	countries.

But	-	and	this	is	a	big	'but'	-	we	have	also	seen	growing	income	inequality within	countries…

In	advanced	economies,	for	example,	the	top	1	percent	of	the	population	now account	for	about	10	per	cent	of	total	income.	And	the	gap	between	rich	and poor	is	even	wider	when	it	comes	to	wealth.	Oxfam 3 	estimates	that,	in	2016,	the combined	wealth	of	the	world's	richest	1	per	cent	will	overtake	that	of	the	other 99	percent	of	people…

If	you	put	all	this	together,	you	see	a	striking	divergence	between	a	positive global	trend	and	mostly	negative	trends	within	countries.

China,	for	example,	has	been	at	the	sharp	end	of	both	trends.	By	lifting	more than	600	million	people	out	of	poverty	over	the	past	three	decades,	China	has made	a	remarkable	contribution	to	greater	global	equality	of	income.	But	in	the process,	it	has	become	one	of	the	world's	most	unequal	societies	-	because	many rural	areas	remain	poor	and	because	income	and	wealth	have	risen	sharply	in	the cities	and	at	the	top	levels	of	Chinese	society.

In	fact,	economies	like	China	and	India	seem	to	fit	neatly	into	a	traditional narrative,	which	says	that	extreme	inequality	is	an	acceptable	price	to	pay	for economic	growth…

But	there	is	a	growing	new	consensus	that	countries	should	not	accept	this Faustian	trade-off.	For	example,	analysis	by	my	colleagues	at	the	IMF	has shown	that	excessive	income	inequality	actually	drags	down	the	economic growth	rate	and	makes	growth	less	sustainable	over	time.

Earlier	this	week,	we	released	our	latest	IMF	analysis, 4 	which	provides	the	hard numbers	for	my	key	message	-	that	you	need	to	lift	the	'small	boats'	to	generate stronger	and	more	durable	growth.

Our	research	shows	that,	if	you	lift	the	income	share	of	the	poor	and	middle	class by	one	percentage	point,	then	GDP	growth	increases	by	as	much	as	0.38 percentage	points	in	a	country	over	five	years.	By	contrast,	if	you	lift	the	income share	of	the	rich	by	one	percentage	point,	then	GDP	growth	decreases	by	0.08 percentage	points.	One	possible	explanation	is	that	the	rich	spend	a	lower fraction	of	their	incomes,	which	could	reduce	aggregate	demand	and	undermine growth.

In	other	words,	our	findings	suggest	that	-	contrary	to conventional	wisdom	-	the	benefits	of	higher	income are	trickling	up,	not	down.

This,	of	course,	shows	that	the	poor	and	the	middle	class	are	the	main	engines	of growth.	Unfortunately,	these	engines	have	been	stalling…

This	kind	of	inequality	holds	back	growth	because	it	discourages	investment	in skills	and	human	capital	-	which	leads	to	lower	productivity	in	a	large	part	of	the economy.

So,	the	consequences	of	excessive	income	inequality	are	increasingly	clear	-	but what	about	its	causes?

The	most	important	drivers	of	extreme	inequality	are	well	known	technological	progress	and	financial	globalization…

Another	factor	is	the	over-reliance	on	finance	in	major	economies	such	as	the United	States	and	Japan.	Of	course,	finance	-	especially	credit	-	is	essential	to any	prosperous	society.	But	there	is	growing	evidence,	including	from	IMF staff, 	that	too	much	finance	can	distort	the	distribution	of	income,	corrode	the 5 political	process	and	undermine	economic	stability	and	growth.

In	emerging	and	developing	economies,	extreme	income	inequality	is	largely driven	by	an	inequality	of	access	-	to	education,	health	care	and	financial services…

With	these	kinds	of	disadvantages	-	with	this	kind	of	inequality	of	opportunity	millions	of	people	have	little	or	no	chance	of	earning	higher	incomes	and building	up	wealth.	This	is	-	in	the	words	of	Pope	Francis	-	an	'economy	of exclusion'. 6

Policy	makers	can,	in	our	view,	generate	a	swell	under	the	bow	of	the	'small boats'.	There	are	recipes	for	stronger,	more	inclusive	and	more	sustainable growth	in	all	countries.

The	first	priority	-	the	number	one	item	on	the	list	-	should	be	macroeconomic stability.	If	you	do	not	apply	good	monetary	policies,	if	you	indulge	in	fiscal indiscipline,	if	you	allow	your	public	debt	to	balloon,	you	are	bound	to	see slower	growth,	rising	inequality	and	greater	economic	and	financial	instability…

The	second	priority	should	be	prudence.	We	all	know	that	actions	need	to	be taken	to	reduce	excessive	inequality.	But	we	also	know	that	a	certain	level	of inequality	is	healthy	and	helpful.	It	provides	incentives	for	people	to	compete, innovate,	invest	and	seize	opportunities	-	to	upgrade	their	skills,	start	new businesses	and	make	things	happen…

The	next	priority	should	be	to	adjust	policies	to	country-specific	drivers	of inequality,	including	political,	cultural	and	institutional	settings.	No	more	onesize-fits-all,	but	smart	policies	-	potential	game	changers	-	that	could	help reverse	the	trend	towards	greater	inequality.

One	potential	game	changer	is	smart	fiscal	policy.

The	challenge	here	is	to	design	tax	and	spending	measures	that	have	minimal adverse	effects	on	incentives	to	work,	save	and	invest.	The	objective	must	be	to promote	both	greater	equality	and	greater	efficiency.

This	means	widening	the	tax	revenue	base	by	-	for	example	-	clamping	down	on tax	evasion;	reducing	tax	relief	on	mortgage	payments	from	which	the	rich benefit	most; 6 and	reducing	or	removing	tax	relief	on	capital	gains,	stock	options and	the	profits	of	private	equity	investments	funds,	known	as	'carried	interest'.

In	many	European	countries,	it	also	means	reducing	high	labour	taxes…This would	provide	a	strong	incentive	to	create	more	jobs	and	more	full-time positions	-	which	would	help	stem	the	tide	of	part-time	and	temporary	jobs	that have	contributed	to	rising	income	inequality.

On	the	expenditure	side,	it	means	expanding	access	to	education	and	health	care. In	many	emerging	and	developing	economies,	it	means	reducing	energy subsidies	-	which	are	costly	and	inefficient	-	and	using	the	freed-up	resources for	better	education,	training	and	stronger	safety	nets…

Promoting	greater	equality	and	efficiency	also	means	relying	more	on	so-called conditional	cash	transfers.	These	are	immensely	successful	anti-poverty	tools that	have	contributed	significantly	to	the	reduction	in	income	inequality	in countries	such	as	Brazil,	Chile	and	Mexico.

During	my	recent	visit	to	Brazil, 8 I	had	the	opportunity	to	visit	a	favela 	and 9 witness	first-hand	the	so-called	Bolsa	Familia 10 	programme.	This	programme provides	aid	to	poor	families	-	in	the	form	of	pre-paid	debit	cards	-	on	condition that	their	children	go	to	school	and	take	part	in	government	vaccination programmes.

Bolsa	Familia	has	proven	to	be	both	efficient	and	cost-effective:	for	expenditure of	0.5	percent	of	GDP	per	year,	50	million	people	are	being	supported	-	that's one	in	every	four	Brazilians.

In	addition	to	these	smart	fiscal	policies,	there	is	another	potential	game	changer

-	smart	reforms	in	vital	areas	such	as	education,	health	care,	labour	markets, infrastructure	and	financial	inclusion.	These	structural	reforms	are	essential	to lift	potential	economic	growth	and	boost	income	and	living	standards	over	the medium	term.

## If	I	had	to	pick	the	three	most	important	structural	tools to	reduce	excessive	income	inequality,	it	would	be education,	education,	education. 7 …

Higher	incomes	require	higher	human	capital	and	policies	that	bring	together more	teachers	and	students	in	21st-century	class	rooms,	with	better	books	and access	to	online	resources.	Emerging	and	developing	economies	need	to	promote more	equal	access	to	basic	education,	while	advanced	economies	need	to	focus more	on	the	quality	and	affordability	of	university	education…

Another	important	tool	is	labour	market	reform.	Think	of	well-calibrated minimum	wages	and	policies	to	support	job	search	and	skill	matching.	Think	of reforms	to	protect	workers	rather	than	jobs…

Labour	market	reforms	also	have	an	important	gender	dimension.	Across	the globe,	women	have	been	facing	a	triple	disadvantage.	They	are	less	likely	than men	to	have	a	paid	job,	especially	in	the	Middle	East	and	North	Africa.	If	they do	find	paid	employment,	it	is	more	likely	to	be	in	the	informal	sector.	And	if they	eventually	get	a	job	in	the	formal	sector,	they	earn	just	three-quarters	as much	as	men	-	even	with	the	same	level	of	education	and	in	the	same occupation.

Countries	like	Chile	and	the	Netherlands	have	shown	that	you	can	sharply increase	female	labour	force	participation	through	smart	policies	that	emphasise affordable	childcare,	maternity	leave	and	workplace	flexibility.	You	also	need	to remove	legal	barriers	and	tax	discrimination	that	continue	to	hold	back	women in	many	countries.

Worldwide,	there	are	about	865	million	women	who	have	the	potential	to contribute	more	fully	to	the	economy.

So	the	message	is	clear:	if	you	care	about	greater shared	prosperity,	you	need	to	unleash	the	economic power	of	women.

You	also	need	to	foster	greater	financial	inclusion,	especially	in	developing economies.	Think	of	microcredit	initiatives	that	turn	poor	people	-	mostly women	-	into	successful	micro-entrepreneurs	-	as	I	could	recently	see	in	Peru. 8 Think	of	initiatives	to	build	credit	histories	for	people	without	bank	accounts. Think	of	the	transformative	impact	of	cellphone-based	banking,	especially	in Sub-Saharan	Africa.

By	improving	their	access	to	basic	financial	services,	poor	families	in developing	economies	can	invest	more	in	health	and	education,	which	leads	to higher	productivity	and	higher	income	potential…

All	these	policies	and	reforms	require	leadership,	courage	and	collaboration. This	is	why	I	am	calling	on	politicians,	policymakers,	business	leaders	and	all	of us	here	to	translate	good	intentions	into	bold	and	lasting	actions.

In	particular,	policy	makers	need	to	take	advantage	of	what	I	think	is	a	once-in-a generation	opportunity	for	development…

I	sincerely	hope	that,	by	the	end	of	this	year,	we	will	be	able	to	look	back	and say,	'we	did	it'.	'We	re-energised	global	economic	growth.'	'We	reached	a historic	agreement	on	climate	change.'	'And	we	launched	a	brand	new development	agenda	with	ambitious	goals	and	solid	financing.'

On	all	these	issues,	I	see	an	important	role	for	the	IMF.	Our	key	mandate	is	to promote	global	economic	and	financial	stability.	This	is	why	we	have	been deeply	involved	in	development	-	by	helping	our	188	member	countries	to design	and	implement	policies	and	by	lending	to	countries	in	times	of	distress,	so they	can	get	back	on	their	feet…

Consider	the	latest	migrant	tragedies	in	the	Mediterranean 9 	and	on	South-East Asian	shores. 10 These	cramped	migrant	boats	represent	the	most	fragile	states and	communities.	They	are	the	smallest	of	the	'small	boats'	-	a	powerful reminder	of	the	most	extreme	inequality	of	wealth	and	income.	The	economy	of exclusion	is	staring	us	right	in	the	face.

It	is	often	said	that	we	should	measure	the	health	of	our	society	not	at	its	apex, but	at	its	base.	By	lifting	the	'small	boats'	of	the	poor	and	the	middle	class,	we can	build	a	fairer	society	and	a	stronger	economy.	Together,	we	can	create greater	shared	prosperity	-	for	all.

Thank	you.

## British	politician

Hilary	James	Wedgwood	Benn	(1953-)	is	the	second	son	of	the	Labour	Cabinet Minister	Tony	Benn	(1925-2014).	He	read	Russian	and	East	European	studies	at Sussex	University,	then	worked	at	two	trade	unions	and	served	as	deputy	leader of	Ealing	Borough	Council.	He	stood	unsuccessfully	as	a	Labour	candidate	in the	1983	and	1987	general	elections.	He	distanced	himself	from	his	father's famously	far-left	stance,	describing	himself	as	'a	Benn,	not	a	Bennite'	and	was elected	as	MP	for	Leeds	Central	in	1999.	He	was	a	Cabinet	Secretary	in	the governments	led	by	Tony	Blair	and	Gordon	Brown.	Under	Ed	Miliband's leadership	of	the	Labour	Party	he	became	Shadow	Leader	of	the	House	of Commons.	He	was	appointed	as	Shadow	Foreign	Secretary	in	2015,	but	was dismissed	from	the	post	by	the	Labour	leader,	Jeremy	Corbyn,	in	2016.	Like	his father,	he	is	a	teetotaller	and	vegetarian;	unlike	his	father,	he	supports	the	UK's retention	of	a	nuclear	deterrent.
