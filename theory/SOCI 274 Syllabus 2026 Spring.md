This course analyzes social movements throughout history, examining the advocacy strategies that shaped campaigns for social change. Instead of learning passively from textbooks, you will engage with the ideas and perspectives of historical figures, advocating for their viewpoints through speeches, debates, and written arguments. You'll explore two major scenarios, Greenwich Village in 1913 and India in 1945, grappling with complex questions about labor, suffrage, racial and ethnic equality, religious freedom, and national independence by examining the perspectives of activists, politicians, intellectuals, and ordinary citizens. Through this immersive approach, you will develop persuasive communication skills while studying how movements build power, craft compelling narratives, and forge coalitions across diverse communities. This method challenges you to understand not just what people believed, but why they believed it, developing critical thinking skills while engaging with enduring tensions between competing visions of justice.

**The Basic Concept**  
Unlike traditional courses that rely on textbooks and lectures, this class centers on examining historical perspectives through structured debates and discussions. You will develop speaking, writing, critical thinking, and leadership skills while advocating for specific viewpoints from the past.

The course unfolds in three phases. During setup sessions, I provide historical context, assign readings, and introduce the intellectual issues at stake. You'll receive a specific historical perspective to research and understand. Students with similar viewpoints may form factions to develop collaborative strategies. During the active phase, student moderators will facilitate class discussions while I observe and guide when necessary. The goal is meaningful engagement with the relevant historical and philosophical questions through structured debate. Finally, during reflection sessions, we step back from historical perspectives to discuss the broader issues from our contemporary viewpoint, analyzing what we learned about advocacy and social change.

In this course, developing effective communication is crucial for successfully advocating your assigned historical role. Key skills you'll develop include analyzing urgent issues that demand attention, understanding your audience's values and beliefs, pinpointing specific points of conflict or disagreement, recognizing factors that might hinder your persuasive efforts, and strategizing rhetorical tools to overcome challenges and achieve your communication goals. By practicing these analytical and strategic skills with each speech and writing assignment, you'll craft more compelling and persuasive arguments, ultimately enhancing your ability to advocate for your role's perspective. For instance, you might find yourself in the position of a suffrage orator rallying fellow club members, where you'd leverage shared experiences and passion for the cause, or as a follower of Gandhi addressing a skeptical British official, requiring a more measured, diplomatic approach that appeals to broader ideals of justice. These skills will not only serve you well in this course but also prove invaluable in various real-world contexts where effective communication and persuasion are essential.

We will not avoid controversial issues in this course. Instead, historical tension and conflict are central to learning how advocacy works. You may be assigned a role whose social position, identity, or political commitments differ substantially from your own. Because these activities involve speaking from historical perspectives shaped by race, gender, class, and power, it is essential to be clear about what this work is, and what it is not. The exercises in this course are intellectual and analytical, not theatrical. They are not reenactments, performances, or attempts to simulate the lived experience of people in the past. Although roles are often based on real historical figures, no individual role is meant to represent a race, gender, or social group in a monolithic way. Your task is to understand and advance a historically grounded argument, not to imitate a person or identity.

Students should maintain a clear distance between themselves and their assigned roles. You will build your role through scholarly research, evidence, and persuasive reasoning, not through imitation or performance. To avoid stereotyping or appropriation, students will not engage in costumes, accents, dialects, or other forms of embodied impersonation associated with race or gender; modest symbolic items used to indicate political affiliation or role alignment (such as a pin, ribbon, or hat) are permitted and, in some cases, encouraged, provided they are not used to imitate identity or appearance. In addition, we will avoid racist or sexist language from the past, even when engaging with historical materials that contain it. By keeping the focus on ideas, arguments, and historical context, these activities allow us to examine difficult and contested questions about justice and power while maintaining respect for one another in the present.

**Student Learning Outcomes**  
By the end of this course, students will be able to:

* **Analyze historical social movements as strategic efforts to produce social change**, with particular attention to how activists defined problems, identified targets, and selected advocacy strategies within specific historical constraints.  
* **Evaluate how communication, persuasion, and rhetoric shape the success and failure of social movements**, including how arguments are tailored to audiences, power relations, and moments of crisis.  
* **Develop and deliver persuasive arguments from historically grounded perspectives**, using speeches, debates, and written advocacy to advance specific political or social positions.  
* **Adapt advocacy strategies to different audiences and power contexts**, demonstrating an understanding of how status, institutional authority, cultural norms, and political opportunity affect persuasive choices.  
* **Critically interpret primary and secondary sources** to understand how ideas, narratives, and strategic framing interact with broader social, political, and economic forces.  
* **Reflect on advocacy as a contested and strategic process**, drawing lessons from historical cases to assess the challenges of coalition-building, persuasion, and disagreement in contemporary efforts at social change.

This course can be used to fulfill both the Communication Beyond Carolina (COMMBEYOND) and the Power and Society (FC-POWER) general education requirements.

**Course Requirements**

### *Reading*

This course challenges you to actively engage with the past, recognizing that ideas are not static concepts but living, breathing forces that shape and are shaped by their times. This intrinsic connection demands that we examine intellectual concepts within their specific social and historical frameworks, an approach that forms the cornerstone of our entire curriculum. As you dive into the assigned texts, you'll embark on a dual journey of discovery: not only will you examine the arguments and theories presented, but you'll also gain insights into the societal forces that gave rise to these ideas. This immersive approach to studying historical thought enables a richer, more nuanced understanding of how ideas emerge, evolve, and influence the world around them.

The challenge lies in quickly grasping these complex ideas and navigating intricate historical situations. However, this approach offers significant benefits: it develops your critical reading skills, enhances your understanding of how ideas shape societies, and hones your ability to construct and defend arguments within specific historical contexts.  
By embracing this intensive reading and role-playing methodology, you'll cultivate a deep understanding of historical ideas and events while simultaneously developing crucial skills in critical thinking, argumentation, and persuasive communication.

### *Speeches and Class Participation*

Your course grade is primarily determined by your performance in two key areas: speeches and active class participation, which together account for approximately 65% of your final grade. Throughout the semester, you will deliver two formal speeches and engage in frequent class discussions and debates. These activities are designed to hone your persuasive skills, a core objective of this course. A unique aspect of this class is the use of assigned personas. You will often participate in discussions and debates from the perspective of your designated character, adding depth to your arguments and enhancing your ability to consider multiple viewpoints.

Throughout the scenarios in this course, you'll be exposed to various persuasive strategies your classmates employ as they advocate for their historical roles. To actively engage with these diverse arguments and develop your persuasive skills, you'll be taking notes not just on their ideas but also on the effectiveness of speeches from your role's point of view. Consider what resonates with you, what doesn't, and why. This structured feedback process will allow you to analyze how your classmates tailor their arguments to different audiences, assess the effectiveness of their rhetorical strategies, and provide you valuable feedback about what’s working and what’s not in your own speeches. By actively engaging in this feedback loop, you'll gain valuable insights into what resonates with specific audiences and refine your approach to persuasion as each scenario progresses.

### *Writing*

Your written work will be crucial in developing your communication skills and complementing your class presentations. The writing assignments are diverse, encompassing persuasive arguments, critical analyses, and reflective summaries. Many of these written assignments are extended versions of your oral presentations, allowing you to dive deeper into the topics and arguments you present in class. Since the course covers multiple scenarios, you will hone your skills in crafting effective messages across both written and spoken mediums for different audiences. 

During each half of the course, you will complete approximately 6-8 pages of writing, typically divided into two separate assignments. The specific nature of these assignments will vary depending on your role within each scenario. To guide your writing, consult the "Writing for Reacting" appendix in the "Introduction to Reacting" resource on Canvas, which provides four key writing advisories. It's essential to familiarize yourself with these advisories and review them before starting each assignment. Grading for written work will be based on rubrics available on Canvas, ensuring a clear understanding of expectations and assessment criteria.

Your written work is not just for your own development but also for the benefit of your classmates. It will be shared on the Canvas discussion board, fostering a collaborative learning environment. This sharing serves multiple purposes: it allows you to receive valuable peer feedback, provides an audience for your compelling calls to action and carefully crafted arguments, and enables you to engage with and learn from your peers' work. Remember, timely submission of your work to the Canvas discussion board is essential for fulfilling the requirements of each scenario and maximizing the benefits of this collaborative approach. A fiery call for workers to throw down their bonds does no good if the strike has already been defeated\!

You’ll develop robust communication skills applicable across various academic and civic contexts by engaging in this comprehensive writing process, from oral presentation to extended written analysis and peer discussion. This approach enhances your ability to articulate complex ideas in both spoken and written forms and prepares you for real-world scenarios where you may need to present ideas concisely and then elaborate on them in detailed written documents.

The following uses of generative AI tools are permitted in this course: topic selection, brainstorming, outlining and planning, drafting, media creation, peer review, revising, and polishing. While generative AI tools may be used for support, the core arguments, structure, and rhetorical choices must be your own, and you are responsible for defending and performing this work in class.

*Portfolio*  
After each scenario, you will hand in a folder/binder that contains:

* Speech notes: During each session, you will take structured notes on the ideas and persuasiveness of speeches, analyzing their arguments and effectiveness from your role's point of view. These notes will assist you in tracking the multiple advocacy positions, refining your communication strategies, and providing feedback.  
* Speaker note: The index card, or comparable, that you referred to during your presentation.  
* Reading sharing notes: An additional part of your portfolio is your notes from the Primary Reading Sharing. These days, you will be required to summarize one historical document of your choosing in writing from your role’s point of view. During class, you will find another person you think would find this reading interesting and discuss it with them. Your notes on this conversation should go in your portfolio.  
* Reflection and Participation Sheet: This page allows you to describe your participation in class.  
* Any other written work: Provide originals or copies of any additional materials you produced, such as a petition or poster.

**Attendance**  
Because this course relies heavily on in-class discussion, debate, and collaborative work, regular attendance is essential. *You do not earn points for attending class; you only lose points for unexcused absences.* After your second unexcused absence, you will lose one point from your final course grade for each additional unexcused absence. Absences that are officially approved under UNC policy, including those related to disability accommodations, religious observance, pregnancy or related conditions, short-term military service, significant health conditions, or personal/family emergencies, will be treated as excused when documented through the appropriate university office (e.g., EOC, ODOS, or UAAO), consistent with University policy.

**The least you need to know**

* 45% of your grade will be based on your speeches, writing, and participation in Greenwich Village 1913\.  
* 45% of your grade will be based on your speeches, writing, and participation in India 1945\.  
* 10% of your grade will be based on your writing and participation in the final.  
* For each scenario:  
  * 66% of your grade will be based on your speeches, including both the oral version and the written version. Each scenario requires two assignments. The first is worth twice as much as the second.   
  * 22% of your grade will be based on formal and informal class participation.   
  * 11% of your grade will be based on your portfolio.  
* Some roles are more active than others. You will not gain or lose participation points because of the prominence of your role.  
* Readings and due dates for assignments and presentations vary depending on your role. *It is your responsibility to know when your deadlines are and what you have to do.* If you have any questions, ask the TA or me.  
* Written assignments are due at or *before* the beginning of class. Late assignments lose a full letter grade for each calendar day late. Most assignments will be posted to Canvas, where other students can see them. If you would like to make alternate arrangements, please let me know in advance.  
* If you are uncomfortable with your role, let me know. The course is designed to challenge students but not inflict emotional damage.  
* Formal presentations must be made on the assigned day. If you know of a conflict, please consult with me in advance.  
* I will sometimes modify the directions or assignments. You will be informed in advance about these. 

**Course Materials**  
All required readings are on the course Canvas site or [23 Fifth Avenue](https://23-fifth-avenue.pubpub.org).

**Code of Conduct**  
I intend that students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. I intend to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity, like gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. The topics that we’re covering in this class are often difficult, not just intellectually but emotionally. While I expect rigorous discussion and even disagreement during our class discussions, I ask that you engage in dialogue with care and empathy for the other members of the course. Aim to disagree without becoming disagreeable. In this course, we will not shy away from the uncomfortable. Critically examining and assessing assumptions and values is not just one of sociology’s tasks but is an activity vital to engaged citizenship. I will work to ensure a classroom environment that supports you in taking these intellectual and emotional risks. Our Code of Conduct helps ensure that everyone is aware of the types of interactions that foster positive interactions and those that may not.

All students are expected to adhere to University policy and follow the guidelines of the UNC Code of Conduct. Additional information can be found at studentconduct.unc.edu. 

All academic work in this course, including papers, quizzes, and exams, is to be your own work, unless otherwise specifically provided. It is your responsibility if you have any doubt to confirm whether or not collaboration is permitted.

**Course Schedule**  
*Really Important Note:* Each of the two RTTP books has important information about what you need to do and when it needs to be done. When this is in conflict with the syllabus, the syllabus is usually correct. If you have any questions, please ask the TA or me.
