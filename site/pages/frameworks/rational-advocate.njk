<h2>Annotated Example: Temperance Speaker's Reason-Based Approach</h2>

<div class="annotated-speech">
  <div class="speech-paragraph" data-step="1" data-label="Position Statement" style="border-color: {{ fw.color }}">
    <p>The empirical evidence demonstrates conclusively that alcohol consumption stands as the primary driver of social and economic degradation in our modern industrial society. Recent findings from the Bureau of Labor Statistics reveal a stark correlation: fully sixty-seven percent of families seeking charitable assistance have at least one drinking member in their household. This statistic alone should give pause to any rational observer of our social condition.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="speech-paragraph" data-step="2" data-label="Expert Testimony" style="border-color: {{ fw.color }}">
    <p>Further research from Dr. William Howard, the esteemed president of Leland Stanford University, documents alcohol's devastating impact on industrial productivity. His rigorous studies demonstrate an average thirty-two percent decrease in worker efficiency among drinking employees, translating to millions in lost wages and production annually.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="speech-paragraph" data-step="3" data-label="Economic Rebuttal" style="border-color: {{ fw.color }}">
    <p>The liquor interests frequently assert that prohibition would devastate our economy through lost jobs and tax revenue. This argument, while superficially persuasive, crumbles under systematic analysis. Current alcohol tax revenues amount to approximately three hundred million dollars annually. However, our detailed economic assessment reveals alcohol-related costs exceeding three hundred and fifty million dollars per year. These expenses manifest in decreased industrial productivity, increased medical care requirements, expanded criminal justice expenditures, and the mounting costs of supporting destitute families.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="speech-paragraph" data-step="3" data-label="Liberty Rebuttal" style="border-color: {{ fw.color }}">
    <p>The industry's argument regarding personal liberty requires equally careful scrutiny. They frame prohibition as an infringement on individual rights, yet this position ignores the broader social context. Police records demonstrate that eighty percent of arrests directly involve alcohol consumption. One must ask: what of the liberty of wives to live without violence? Of children to receive proper nutrition rather than watch their family wages disappear into saloon tills?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="speech-paragraph" data-step="4" data-label="Cost-Benefit Analysis" style="border-color: {{ fw.color }}">
    <p>The cost-benefit analysis becomes crystal clear. Implementation of prohibition would redirect substantial resources toward productive enterprises: education, infrastructure development, and genuine social advancement. The data demonstrates that every dollar spent on temperance enforcement would yield approximately two dollars and thirty cents in social benefit through reduced crime, improved health outcomes, and increased industrial productivity.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="speech-paragraph" data-step="4" data-label="Proven Results" style="border-color: {{ fw.color }}">
    <p>Consider the documented outcomes from states that have already embraced prohibition. Maine reports a forty percent reduction in poverty assistance requirements. Kansas demonstrates a twenty-eight percent decrease in criminal proceedings. These figures represent not mere correlation, but causation verified through rigorous statistical analysis.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="speech-paragraph" data-step="4" data-label="Logical Conclusion" style="border-color: {{ fw.color }}">
    <p>The evidence compels a single, logical conclusion: prohibition represents the most rational path toward social and economic progress. This conclusion derives not from emotional appeals or moral arguments, but from careful examination of empirical data. The question before us is not one of sentiment but of sound policy based on verifiable evidence. The data speaks unequivocally — temperance offers the most efficient solution to our pressing social challenges.</p>

<h2>Variants</h2>

<div class="variants">
  <details class="variant-item">
    <summary>The Systems Analyst Approach</summary>
    <div class="variant-item__content">
      <p>Treats society like an interconnected network of institutions — education, industry, government, and family life. Demonstrates how one problem area can trigger ripple effects throughout the entire system. By mapping out cause-and-effect loops, the speaker shows that a well-designed policy solution can stabilize multiple sectors at once, highlighting the structural nature of the problem.</p>
    </div>
  </details>
  <details class="variant-item">
    <summary>The Legalist Approach</summary>
    <div class="variant-item__content">
      <p>Grounds the position in established laws, principles, or precedents — from constitutional documents, judicial rulings, or legislative acts. Shows how a current problem either violates fundamental rights or clashes with the spirit of existing legal frameworks. Frames reform as a way of upholding justice, ensuring public safety, or reaffirming core civic values.</p>
